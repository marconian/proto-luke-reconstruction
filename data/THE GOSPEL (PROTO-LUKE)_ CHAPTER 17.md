The following is the forensic reconstruction of the **seventeenth chapter** of the **Jamesian Protograph** (Proto-Luke), which corresponds to the nineteenth chapter of the canonical text 1, 2\. This chapter focuses on the radical economic redistribution exemplified by Zacchaeus and the clinical judgment of stewardship in the parable of the minas 3, 4\.  
Notably, this stratum undergoes a significant textual rupture: the entire narrative of the "Triumphal Entry" into Jerusalem (canonical verses 29–46) is entirely absent from the primitive source, reflecting a different chronological and theological horizon than the later canonical harmonization 5-7.

### THE GOSPEL (PROTO-LUKE): CHAPTER 17

**19:1** This verse is **Unattested** in the primitive stratum 8\. **2** And behold, a man named **Zacchaeus** 8, 9\. **3–5** These verses are **Unattested** in the primitive stratum 8\. **6** And he **received him** 8, 9\. **7** This verse is **Unattested** in the primitive stratum 8\. **8** And Zacchaeus said: "Behold, the **half... of my possessions... I give** to the poor, and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusation, **fourfold I return** it" 8, 9\. **9** And Jesus said to him: "**Today salvation has come to this house**" 8, 9\. **10** "For the **son of man** came to **save the lost**" 8-10.

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* **Zacchaeus (Ζακχαῖος):** *Tertullian identifies Zacchaeus as a foreigner (allophylus), yet his presence is retained as a dry fact of the Messenger’s interaction with those outside the elite 9\.*  
* **Possessions (ὑπαρχόντων \- hyparchontōn):** *The term denotes material debris or property; Zacchaeus’s act is the clinical liquidation of capital for communal use 4, 9\.*  
* **Fourfold (τετραπλοῦν \- tetraploun):** *The order of "fourfold I return" (τετραπλοῦν ἀποδίδωμι) is specific to the earlier witnesses, matching the Latin translations used by Tertullian 9\.*  
* **Save the lost (σῶσαι τὸ ἀπολωλός \- sōsai to apolōlos):** *The primitive stratum notably omits "seek" (ζητῆσαι). The Messenger’s function is defined here as the final recovery of the human form from its state of debris 10\.*

**11** And he spoke a **parable** 8, 11\. **12** This verse is **Unattested** in the primitive stratum 8\. **13** And calling ten of his **slaves**, he **gave them ten minas** and said to them: "Trade with these until I come" 8, 11\. **14–21** These verses are **Unattested** in the primitive stratum 5, 11\. **22** And he says to him: "Out of your own mouth I will judge you, you wicked **slave**. You knew that I am an **austere man, taking what I did not lay down and reaping what I did not sow**" 5, 11\. **23** "Why then did you not give my money to the bank, that coming I might have required it with **interest**?" 5, 11\. **24–25** These verses are **Unattested** in the primitive stratum 5, 11\. **26** "For I say to you, that to everyone who has it shall be given; but from him who has not, even **what he seems to have** shall be taken from him" 5, 11\. **27–28** These verses are **Unattested** in the primitive stratum 5\.

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* **Slaves (δούλους \- doulous):** *Per the translation philosophy, "slaves" is used instead of "servants" to denote the absolute domestic authority of the Master (the Spirit) over his agents 8, 11\.*  
* **Austere (αὐστηρός \- austēros):** *The term describes a clinical, rigorous nature, used by the Master to expose the slave's internal lack of productivity 11\.*  
* **Interest (τόκῳ \- tokō):** *This refers to the increase or fruit required of those entrusted with the Word 11\.*  
* **What he seems to have (ὃ δοκεῖ ἔχειν \- ho dokei echein):** *This variant, found in Marcion and several early Greek witnesses, suggests that the "unprofitable slave" only possessed an appearance of wealth/knowledge, which is exposed as debris upon judgment 5, 11\.*

**19:29–46** The narrative of the **Triumphal Entry**, the donkey, and the cleansing of the Temple is **Not Present** in this stratum 5, 6, 12-14.

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* **Omission of the Entry:** *Epiphanius and other witnesses explicitly state that Marcion’s text "jumped over" (anepēdēse) this section 14\. This omission removes the Messianic political theater of entering Jerusalem, keeping the focus on the internal teaching of the Travel Narrative 2, 6\.*

**19:47–48** These verses are **Unattested** in the primitive stratum 5\.

### Additional Explanation: The Stewardship of the Word

Chapter 17 of the Protograph defines the **Economics of Judgment**.

1. **The Case of Zacchaeus:** The story is a forensic demonstration of the "Ebionite" ethic 3\. Zacchaeus is not saved by faith in an abstract sense, but by the clinical act of returning stolen capital and liquidating his property 4, 9\. This serves as the ultimate realization of the "Law of Liberty" within the community of the poor 15\.  
2. **The Rejection of the Temple Entry:** By omitting the Triumphal Entry (19:29–46), the Protograph avoids portraying Jesus as a Davidic king claiming the physical Temple 16, 17\. Instead, the narrative transitions directly from the stewardship of the minas to the internal reality of the Messenger’s authority, stripping away the post-70 CE political "plaster" applied by later canonical editors 6, 18\.  
3. **The Austere Master:** The parable of the minas (19:11-26) functions as a warning against the "unprofitable" state 11\. The judgment is based strictly on the "use" of what was given; the slave who treats the Word as static debris (wrapping it in a cloth) is stripped of even his "appearance" of possession 5, 18\.
