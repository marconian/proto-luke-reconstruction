### THE GOSPEL (PROTO-LUKE): CHAPTER 11 (Greek)

**13:10** Ἦν δὲ διδάσκων ἐν μιᾷ τῶν συναγωγῶν ἐν τοῖς σάββασιν. **18** Ἔλεγεν οὖν· Τίνι ὁμοία ἐστὶν ἡ βασιλεία τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ τίνι ὁμοιώσω αὐτήν; **19** ὁμοία ἐστὶν κόκκῳ σινάπεως, ὃν λαβὼν ἄνθρωπος ἔβαλεν εἰς κῆπον ἑαυτοῦ, καὶ ηὔξησεν καὶ ἐγένετο εἰς δένδρον, καὶ τὰ πετεινὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ κατεσκήνωσεν ἐν τοῖς κλάδοις αὐτοῦ. **24** Ἀγωνίζεσθε εἰσελθεῖν διὰ τῆς στενῆς θύρας, ὅτι πολλοί, λέγω ὑμῖν, ζητήσουσιν εἰσελθεῖν καὶ οὐκ ἰσχύσουσιν. **25** ἀφ᾿ οὗ ἂν ἐγερθῇ ὁ οἰκοδεσπότης καὶ ἀποκλείσῃ τὴν θύραν καὶ ἄρξησθε ἔξω ἑστάναι καὶ κρούειν τὴν θύραν λέγοντες· Κύριε, ἄνοιξον ἡμῖν, καὶ ἀποκριθεὶς ἐρεῖ ὑμῖν· Οὐκ οἶδα ὑμᾶς πόθεν ἐστέ. **28** ἐκεῖ ἔσται ὁ κλαυθμὸς καὶ ὁ βρυγμὸς τῶν ὀδόντων, ὅταν ὄψησθε **πάντας τοὺς δικαίους** ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ τοῦ θεοῦ, ὑμᾶς δὲ **κρατουμένους** ἔξω. **29** καὶ ἥξουσιν ἀπὸ ἀνατολῶν καὶ δυσμῶν καὶ ἀπὸ βορρᾶ καὶ νότου καὶ ἀνακλιθήσονται ἐν τῇ βασιλείᾳ τοῦ θεοῦ.

* *Notes on Greek Text and Reconstruction:*  
* **Excision of 13:1–9:** *The reports on the Galileans and the parable of the fig tree are entirely absent from this stratum. These are identified as later moralizing additions designed to justify the destruction of Jerusalem as a divine tragedy 1\.*  
* **δένδρον (dendron):** *The "tree." In the Jamesian context, this represents the communal growth of the poor into a stable pneumatic shelter.*  
* **στενῆς θύρας (stenēs thyras):** *The "narrow door." This forensic term defines the stringent requirements for entry into the community of the Ebionim 2\.*  
* **Οὐκ οἶδα ὑμᾶς πόθεν ἐστέ (Ouk oida hymas pothen este):** *“I do not know where you are from.” The Master’s refusal is clinical, rejecting those who lack the internal signature of the Spirit despite external proximity 1\.*  
* **πάντας τοὺς δικαίους (pantas tous dikaious):** *“All the righteous.” This is a critical Jamesian variant where the names of the patriarchs (Abraham, Isaac, Jacob) are replaced by a general ethical category. This prioritizes "Doing" and ethical status over biological or national lineage 3\.*  
* **κρατουμένους (kratoumenous):** *“Being kept/held back.” I have restored this variant over the canonical "thrown out" (ekballomenous). It denotes a state of being prevented or hindered from entering the pneumatic order 3\.*  
* **Excision of 13:31–35:** *The departure from Galilee and the "Jerusalem Lament" are excised. These are recognized as secondary "Pastoral" layers intended to harmonize the text with Davidic piety and the post-70 CE ruin of the city 1\.*
