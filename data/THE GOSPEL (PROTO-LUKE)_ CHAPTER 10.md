The following is the forensic reconstruction of the tenth chapter of the **Jamesian Protograph** (Proto-Luke), which corresponds to the twelfth chapter of the canonical text. This stratum continues the "Travel Narrative," focusing on the internal vigilance of the community, the clinical rejection of material anxiety, and the radical division between the "Kingdom" and the established socio-religious order 1, 2\.

### THE GOSPEL (PROTO-LUKE): CHAPTER 10

**12:2** But nothing is covered that will not be revealed, and nothing is hidden that will not be known 3, 4\. **4** And I say to you, my friends: Do not fear those who are able to kill you only, and after this have no power over you 4, 5\. **5** But I will show you whom to fear: fear him who, after killing, has authority to cast into **Gehenna** 4, 6\.  
**8** And I say to you: Everyone who confesses in me before men, the **son of man** shall also confess in him before God 4, 7\. **9** But the one having denied me before men shall be denied before God 4, 8\. **10** And everyone who shall speak a word against the **son of man**, it shall be forgiven him; but to the one having spoken against the **Holy Spirit**, it shall not be forgiven 9, 10\.  
**11** And when they bring you before the assemblies and the rulers and the authorities, do not worry how you shall defend or what you shall say 11\. **12** For **the Holy Spirit** shall teach you in that very hour what it is necessary to say 4, 11\. **13** And someone from the crowd said to him: "Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me" 12\. **14** But he said to him: "Man, who appointed me a **judge** or a **divider** over you?" 4, 12\. **20** But God said to him: "Fool\! In this night they require your soul from you; and the things you prepared, whose shall they be?" 4, 13\.  
**22** And he said to his disciples: "Therefore I say to you, do not worry for your soul, what you shall eat; nor for the body, what you shall put on" 4, 14\. **24** "Consider the **ravens**, for they do not sow nor reap, which have no storehouse nor barn, and God feeds them" 4, 15\. **30** "For the nations of the world seek after all these things, but your Father knows that you have need of these" 15\. **31** "But seek the kingdom of God, and these things shall be added to you" 4, 15\. **32** "Fear not, little flock, for your Father was well-pleased to give you the kingdom" 16, 17\.  
**35** "Let your loins be girded and your lamps burning" 4\. **37** "Blessed are those **slaves** whom the lord, having come, shall find watching" 4\. **38** "And if he comes in the **evening watch**, and finds them thus, blessed are those slaves" 4\. **40** "And you, become ready, for in the hour you do not think, the **son of man** comes" 4\. **41** And Peter said to him: "Lord, do you speak this parable to us or also to all?" 4, 18\.  
**49** "I came to cast fire upon the earth" 19, 20\. **51** "Do you think that I have arrived to give peace on the earth? I tell you, no, but **division**" 19, 20\. **53** "The father shall be divided against the son and the son against the father, mother against daughter and daughter against mother" 20\. **56** "**Hypocrites**\! You know how to judge the face of the heaven and of the earth, but how do you not judge this time?" 20, 21\.  
*Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*

* **Gehenna (γέενναν \- geennan):**  
* *I have retained "Gehenna" rather than the Western "Hell" to maintain the specific Judean topographic metaphor for the place of disorder Turn 2, Turn 6\.*  
* **Kill you only (ὑμᾶς μόνον ἀποκτέννειν \- hymas monon apoktennein):**  
* *The Jamesian Protograph likely omitted "body" (σῶμα) in verse 4, focusing the threat directly on the "you" (the self), emphasizing the existential nature of martyrdom in the early Jerusalem community 4, 5\.*  
* **Before God (ἐνώπιον τοῦ θεοῦ \- enōpion tou theou):**  
* *In verses 8 and 9, I have omitted the later canonical addition of "messengers" (angels), as the earliest witnesses (Tertullian/Epiphanius) reflect a more direct pneumatic accountability before the Divine 7, 8\.*  
* **Judge or Divider (κριτὴν ἢ μεριστήν \- kritēn ē meristēn):**  
* *The term "divider" is the literal translation of μεριστήν, denoting a functional office of legal distribution 4, 12\.*  
* **Ravens (κόρακας \- korakas):**  
* *I have translated this literally; the specific use of "ravens" rather than "birds" (Matthew) is a Proto-Lukan hallmark linking Jesus to the feeding of Elijah 4, 15\.*  
* **Slaves (δοῦλοι \- douloi):**  
* *Per the translation philosophy, "slaves" is used instead of "servants" to reflect the total, non-negotiable loyalty required of the community members toward their Lord Turn 2, Turn 4\.*  
* **Evening Watch (ἑσπερινῇ φυλακῇ \- hesperinē phylakē):**  
* *Source 4 identifies this as the specific variant in the Jamesian Protograph, suggesting a much more urgent, immediate context for the Parousia than the later canonical "second or third watch."*  
* **Division (διαμερισμόν \- diamerismon):**  
* *This term is used specifically as a counterpoint to "peace," representing the "shattering of the vessel" required to establish the Kingdom 19, 20\.*

### Additional Explanation: The Epistemology of Use

Chapter 10 of the Protograph articulates the movement's radical **Anti-Anxiety Protocol**.

1. **The Rejection of Material Worry:** By commanding the disciples to "Consider the ravens" (12:24) and "the lilies" (12:27), Jesus establishes a lifestyle of total reliance on the **Divine Influx** (Providence). This was the economic substrate of the Jerusalem *Ebionim* (The Poor), who surrendered private property to live in a community of "Use" 22, 23\.  
2. **The Divider of Inheritance:** Jesus's refusal to adjudicate a property dispute (12:14) is a clinical rejection of the "Old Aeon" legalism. He asserts that his authority is not to regulate the distribution of material "debris" but to restore the internal state of humanity 24, 25\.  
3. **The Fire of Division:** The "Fire" and "Division" mentioned in 12:49-51 serve as a forensic warning that the Truth is not an irenic synthesis but a sword of separation. It severs the follower from biological family ties (12:53) and social approval (12:8-9) to foster absolute loyalty to the Spirit 26, 27\.  
4. **The Archeology of the Soul:** The warning against "Hypocrites" who can read the weather but not the "Time" (12:56) targets those who rely on external sensory data (the "Serpent" principle) while ignoring the internal arrival of the Divine Human in ultimates 28, 29\.
