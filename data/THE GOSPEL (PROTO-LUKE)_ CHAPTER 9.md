The following is the forensic reconstruction of the ninth chapter of the **Jamesian Protograph** (Proto-Luke). This section contains the transition from the mission of the seventy into the internal cultic and polemical instructions of the movement. It features the primitive "Spirit-centered" version of the Lord’s Prayer and the decisive "Beelzebul" controversy, where Jesus defines the mechanics of the Divine Influx.  
In this stratum, the narrative continues to excise secondary "Orthodox" or "Harmonizing" layers, such as the specific "Sign of Jonah" and the "Wisdom of God" speech, which were later used to tether the narrative to the prophetic logic of the Old Aeon 1, 2\.

### THE GOSPEL (PROTO-LUKE): CHAPTER 9

**11:1** And it happened that while he was in a certain place praying, as he ceased, one of his disciples said to him: "Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples" 3\. **2** And he said to them: "When you pray, say: Father, hallowed be your name. **Let your Holy Spirit come upon us and cleanse us**" 4, 5\. **3** "Give us day by day our daily bread" 5\. **4** "And forgive us our sins, for we ourselves forgive everyone who is indebted to us; and **do not let us be led into temptation**" 5\.

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* **The Holy Spirit Petition (11:2):** *Reconstruction replaces "Thy Kingdom Come" with the petition for the Spirit. This reading is preserved in the Marcionite/Jamesian tradition and manuscripts like 162 and 700 5\. It reflects the primitive pneumatic Christology of the Jerusalem Pillars, where the "Kingdom" is the internal cleansing by the Spirit rather than an external political arrival 5, 6\.*  
* **Led into Temptation (μὴ ἀφὲς ἡμᾶς εἰσενεχθῆναι \- mē aphes hēmas eisenechthēnai):** *The construction "do not let us be led" is used instead of the active "lead us not." This is a dry forensic correction to avoid the theological absurdity of the Good Father acting as a tempter, a key feature of the Jamesian/Marcionite strata 5, 7\.*

**9** "And I say to you: Ask, and it shall be given to you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened to you" 8\. **11** "What father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will instead of a fish give him a snake? 9 **12** Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion?" 9\. **13** "If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall the Father give the **Holy Spirit** to those who ask him?" 8\.

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* **Holy Spirit (πνεῦμα ἅγιον):** *The specific gift of the Father in the Protograph is the Spirit, grounding the "Epistemology of Influx" where divine power is mediated directly to the individual 8, 10\.*

**14** And he was casting out a **messenger** spirit that was mute 8\. **15** But some of them said: "In **Beelzebul**, the prince of the messengers, he casts out messengers" 11\. **17** But he, knowing their thoughts, said to them: **18** "If Satan also is divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? 9\. **19** And if I by Beelzebul cast out messengers, by whom do your sons cast them out? 8\. **20** But if I by the **finger of God** cast out messengers, then the kingdom of God has come near upon you" 8\.

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* **Messenger (δαιμόνιον \- daimonion):** *Translated literally as a functional entity of the unseen world, stripped of medieval religious baggage turn 2, turn 6\.*  
* **Beelzebul:** *The spelling follows the primitive tradition. Jesus’s response highlights the "Kingdom" as a field of power (finger of God) rather than a geographical territory 8, 12\.*

**27** And it happened, while he said these things, a certain woman out of the crowd, lifting up her voice, said to him: "Blessed is the womb that bore you and the breasts which you sucked\!" 13\. **28** But he said: "Rather, blessed are those hearing the word of God and **doing** it" 14\.

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* **Doing (ποιοῦντες \- poiountes):** *This is the definitive marker of the Jamesian Protograph. Jesus immediately pivots from biological glorification (the womb/breasts) to the "Epistemology of Use" (the doing of the word) 14, 15\.*

**39** "Now you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and the platter, but your inside is full of robbery and wickedness" 2\. **40** "Fools\! Did not he who made the outside make the inside also?" 16\. **42** "Woe to you Pharisees\! For you tithe mint and rue and every herb, but you pass over **the calling** and the love of God" 16, 17\. **52** "Woe to you **lawyers**\! For you took away the **key of knowledge**; you yourselves did not enter, and those entering you hindered" 16, 18\.

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* **The Calling (τὴν κλῆσιν \- tēn klēsin):** *Reconstruction follows the variant "calling" instead of "judgment" (κρίσιν), as attested in the earliest Marcionite/Jamesian records. This emphasizes the vocational nature of the community 17, 19\.*  
* **Lawyers (νομικοῖς \- nomikois):** *Refers to specialists in the Torah. The "Key of Knowledge" (gnōsis) refers to the internal interpretation of the Law that the institutional elite had suppressed 16, 20\.*  
* **Excision of 11:30-32 and 11:49-51:** *The references to the "Sign of Jonah" and the "Wisdom of God" are recognized as later interpolations. In the Jamesian core, Jesus does not require the "Sign of Jonah" to validate his authority, nor does he appeal to a personified "Wisdom" to justify the persecution of prophets; his authority is clinical and self-evident in the restoration of the poor 1, 2\.*

### Additional Explanation: The Interior Kingdom

Chapter 9 of the Jamesian Protograph represents the "Internalization of the Law."

1. **The Pneumatic Prayer:** By focusing the Lord’s Prayer on the "cleansing of the Spirit," the Protograph defines the Kingdom not as a future Roman-style empire, but as an immediate internal state of order.  
2. **The Finger of God:** The Beelzebul controversy establishes the "Actual Jesus" as a conduit of Influx. His power is a "clinical fact" (the finger of God) that restores human form by displacing the "debris" of spiritual disorder.  
3. **The Critique of Externalism:** The Woes (11:39-52) function as a forensic assault on the "State Stabilization" of the Pharisees. Jesus identifies "cleanness" as an internal attribute of the soul rather than a ritual attribute of the cup or the flesh. This aligns with the "Jamesian Layer," which prioritizes the internal "Royal Law of Liberty" over the dead forms of the Temple hierarchy 16, 21\.
