The following is the forensic reconstruction of the **fifteenth chapter** of the **Jamesian Protograph** (Proto-Luke), which corresponds to the seventeenth chapter of the canonical text 1\. This specific stratum is defined by its focus on internal communal discipline, the rejection of "unprofitable" status for active followers, and the clinical definition of the Kingdom as an internal pneumatic state 2, 3\.  
In this reconstruction, the narrative logic is restored by situating the healing of the lepers alongside the historical precedent of Naaman the Syrian—a structural hallmark of the primitive source that was later displaced in the canonical harmonization 4, 5\.

### THE GOSPEL (PROTO-LUKE): CHAPTER 15

**17:1** And he said to his disciples: "It is impossible that **stumbling blocks** should not come; but woe to him through whom they come\!" 6\. **2** "It would be better for him if a **millstone** were hanged about his neck and he were thrown into the sea, than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble" 6\. **3** "Take heed to yourselves. If your brother sins, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him" 6, 7\. **4** "And if he sins against you seven times in a day, and seven times turns back to you, saying, 'I repent,' you shall forgive him" 6, 7\.

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* **Stumbling blocks (σκάνδαλα \- skandala):** *Retained in its forensic sense of a trap or impediment to the path, avoiding the softer "offenses" 6, 8\.*  
* **Millstone (μυλικὸς λίθος \- mylikos lithos):** *The Jamesian layer emphasizes concrete material consequences for those who disrupt the internal order of the "Poor" 6, 9\.*

**10** "So also you, when you have done all the things commanded you, say: 'We have done what we were obligated to do'" 10, 11\.

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* **Omission of "Unprofitable Slaves" (17:10b):** *The phrase "We are unprofitable slaves" (ἀχρεῖοι δοῦλοί ἐσμεν) is explicitly absent in this stratum 10, 12\. In the Jamesian matrix, the slave (δοῦλος \- doulos) is defined by his "doing" (Ma'asim); a slave who follows the "Law of Liberty" is inherently profitable to the community and the Master 13-15.*

**11** And it happened that while he was going to Jerusalem, he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee 16, 17\. **12** And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten **lepers** 16, 18\.  
**4:27** "And he said: 'There were many lepers in Israel in the days of **Elisha** the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, except **Naaman** the Syrian'" 5, 17\.  
**17:14** And seeing them, he said to them: "Go, show yourselves to the **priests**." And it happened that while they were going, they were cleansed 16, 18\. **15** And one of them, seeing that he was healed, turned back, with a loud voice glorifying God 16, 18\. **16** And he fell upon his face at his feet, giving him thanks; and he was a **Samaritan** 16, 19\. **19** And he said to him: "Arise, go; your **faith** has saved you" 16, 19\.

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* **Lepers (λεπροί \- leproi):** *The structural displacement of the Naaman reference (4:27) into this narrative is a primary characteristic of the Jamesian Protograph, providing a forensic scriptural warrant for the healing of the non-Israelite 5, 20\.*  
* **Priests (ἱερεῦσιν \- hiereusin):** *The command functions as a clinical validation within the legal framework, even as the narrative highlights the Samaritan to subvert institutional boundaries 21, 22\.*

**20** And having been questioned by the Pharisees as to when the kingdom of God comes, he answered them and said: "The kingdom of God does not come with **observation**" 16, 23, 24\. **21** "Neither shall they say, 'Behold, here\!' or 'Behold, there\!'; for behold, the kingdom of God is **within you**" 16, 23, 24\.

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* **Observation (παρατηρήσεως \- paraterēseos):** *This term refers to the outward monitoring of celestial or political signs 24\. The Protograph rejects the external "State" model of the Kingdom in favor of a pneumatic reality 2, 25\.*  
* **Within you (ἐντὸς ὑμῶν \- entos hymon):** *The Kingdom is defined as an internal state of order, accessible through the spirit rather than sensory debris 23, 24\.*

**22** And he said to the disciples: "The days will come when you will desire to see one of the days of the **son of man**, and you will not see it" 26, 27\. **25** "But first it is necessary for him to suffer many things and to be **rejected** by this generation" 28, 29\. **26** "And as it was in the days of **Noah**, so shall it be also in the days of the son of man" 26, 30\. **28** "Likewise also as it happened in the days of **Lot**..." 26, 30\. **32** "**Remember Lot’s wife**" 26, 30\.

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* **Rejected (ἀποδοκιμασθῆναι \- apodokimasthenai):** *A forensic term for being "disqualified" after examination; the rejection is a clinical necessity before the unveiling of the Son of Man 28, 29\.*  
* **Lot's Wife:** *This stark warning serves as a direct command to detach the self from the material "debris" (possessions) of the old age 30, 31\.*
