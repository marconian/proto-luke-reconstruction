### THE GOSPEL (PROTO-LUKE): CHAPTER 10

**12:2** Οὐδὲν δὲ συγκεκαλυμμένον ἐστὶν ὃ οὐκ ἀποκαλυφθήσεται καὶ κρυπτὸν ὃ οὐ γνωσθήσεται 1\.**12:2** But nothing is covered that will not be revealed, and nothing is hidden that will not be known 2\.

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* ***Revealed/Known (ἀποκαλυφθήσεται/γνωσθήσεται):** The Jamesian Protograph emphasizes that internal spiritual states will inevitably be manifested in external actions 2\.*

**12:4** Λέγω δὲ ὑμῖν τοῖς φίλοις μου, μὴ φοβηθῆτε ἀπὸ τῶν ἀποκτεννόντων ὑμᾶς μόνον καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα μὴ ἐχόντων περισσότερόν τι ποιῆσαι 1\. **5** ὑποδείξω δὲ ὑμῖν τίνα φοβηθῆτε· φοβήθητε τὸν μετὰ τὸ ἀποκτεῖναι ἔχοντα ἐξουσίαν ἐμβαλεῖν εἰς τὴν **γέενναν** 1\.**12:4** And I say to you, my friends: Do not fear those who are able to kill you only, and after this have no power over you 2\. **5** But I will show you whom to fear: fear him who, after killing, has authority to cast into **Gehenna** 2\.

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* ***Kill you only (ὑμᾶς μόνον ἀποκτέννειν):** The Jamesian Protograph likely omitted "body" (σῶμα) in verse 4, focusing the threat directly on the "you"—the existential self—emphasizing the nature of martyrdom in the early Jerusalem community 2, 3\.*  
* ***Gehenna (γέενναν \- geennan):** I have retained "Gehenna" rather than the Western "Hell" to maintain the specific Judean topographic metaphor for the place of disorder 2, 3\.*

**12:8** Λέγω δὲ ὑμῖν, πᾶς ὃς ἂν ὁμολογήσῃ ἐν ἐμοὶ ἔμπροσθεν τῶν ἀνθρώπων, καὶ ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου ὁμολογήσει ἐν αὐτῷ ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ θεοῦ 1\. **9** ὁ δὲ ἀρνησάμενός με ἐνώπιον τῶν ἀνθρώπων ἀπαρνηθήσεται ἐνώπιον τοῦ θεοῦ 1\.**12:8** And I say to you, everyone who confesses in me before men, the Son of Man will also confess in him before God; 2 **9** but the one who denies me before men will be denied before God 2\.

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* ***Before God (ἐνώπιον τοῦ θεοῦ):** In verses 8 and 9, I have omitted the later canonical addition of "messengers" (angels), as the earliest witnesses (Tertullian/Epiphanius) reflect a more direct pneumatic accountability before the Divine 2, 3\.*  
* ***Son of Man (υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου):** Identifying the Messenger as the eschatological representative of humanity in its restored state 4\.*

**12:14** Ὁ δὲ εἶπεν αὐτῷ· ἄνθρωπε, τίς με κατέστησεν **κριτὴν ἢ μεριστήν** ἐφ᾽ ὑμᾶς; 1 **15** εἶπεν δὲ πρὸς αὐτούς· ὁρᾶτε καὶ φυλάσσεσθε ἀπὸ πάσης πλεονεξίας 1\.**12:14** But he said to him, "Man, who appointed me a **judge or a divider** over you?" 2 **15** And he said to them, "See and guard yourselves against all greed" 2\.

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* ***Judge or Divider (κριτὴν ἢ μεριστήν):** The term "divider" is the literal translation of μεριστήν, denoting a functional office of legal distribution 2, 3\.*  
* ***Greed (πλεονεξίας):** The warning highlights the radical division between the Kingdom and the material debris of the old order 2\.*

**12:16** Εἶπεν δὲ παραβολὴν πρὸς αὐτοὺς λέγων· Ἀνθρώπου τινὸς πλουσίου εὐφόρησεν ἡ χώρα 1\. **18** καὶ εἶπεν· τοῦτο ποιήσω· καθελῶ μου τὰς ἀποθήκας καὶ μείζονας οἰκοδομήσω καὶ συνάξω ἐκεῖ πάντα τὰ γενήματά μου 1\. **20** εἶπεν δὲ αὐτῷ ὁ θεός· ἄφρων, ταύτῃ τῇ νυκτὶ τὴν ψυχήν σου ἀπαιτοῦσιν ἀπὸ σοῦ· ἃ δὲ ἡτοίμασας, τίνι ἔσται; 1\.**12:16** And he spoke a parable to them, saying: "The land of a certain rich man brought forth abundantly." 2 **18** "And he said, 'I will do this: I will pull down my storehouses and build greater ones, and there I will gather all my produce.'" 2 **20** "But God said to him, 'Fool, this night they require your soul from you; and the things you prepared, whose will they be?'" 2\.

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* ***Require (ἀπαιτοῦσιν):** A clinical term denoting the collection of a debt, signaling the abrupt termination of material life 2\.*

**12:22** Εἶπεν δὲ πρὸς τοὺς μαθητάς· διὰ τοῦτο λέγω ὑμῖν· μὴ μεριμνᾶτε τῇ ψυχῇ τί φάγητε, μηδὲ τῷ σώματι τί ἐνδύσησθε 1\. **24** κατανοήσατε τοὺς **κόρακας** ὅτι οὐ σπείρουσιν οὐδὲ θερίζουσιν 1\. **30** ταῦτα γὰρ πάντα τὰ ἔθνη τοῦ κόσμου ἐπιζητοῦσιν· ὑμῶν δὲ ὁ πατὴρ οἶδεν ὅτι χρήζετε τούτων 1\. **31** πλὴν ζητεῖτε τὴν βασιλείαν τοῦ θεοῦ, καὶ ταῦτα πάντα προστεθήσεται ὑμῖν 1\.**12:22** And he said to the disciples: "Therefore I say to you: Do not be anxious for the soul, what you will eat, nor for the body, what you will put on." 2 **24** "Consider the **ravens**, that they do not sow nor reap." 2 **30** "For all these things the nations of the world seek; but your Father knows that you have need of these things." 2 **31** "Nevertheless, seek the kingdom of God, and all these things will be added to you" 2\.

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* ***Ravens (κόρακας \- korakas):** Translated literally; the specific use of "ravens" rather than "birds" (as in Matthew) is a Proto-Lukan hallmark linking the community to the feeding of Elijah 2, 3\.*

**12:35** Ἔστωσαν ὑμῶν αἱ ὀσφύες περιεζωσμέναι καὶ οἱ λύχνοι καιόμενοι 1\. **37** μακάριοι οἱ **δοῦλοι** ἐκεῖνοι, οὓς ἐλθὼν ὁ κύριος εὑρήσει γρηγοροῦντας 1\. **38** κἂν ἐν τῇ **ἑσπερινῇ φυλακῇ** ἔλθῃ καὶ εὕρῃ οὕτως, μακάριοί εἰσιν 1\.**12:35** "Let your loins be girded and your lamps burning." 2 **37** "Blessed are those **slaves** whom the lord, when he comes, shall find watching." 2 **38** "And if he comes in the **evening watch** and finds them so, blessed are they" 2\.

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* ***Slaves (δοῦλοι \- douloi):** Per the translation philosophy, "slaves" is used instead of "servants" to reflect the total, non-negotiable loyalty required of community members toward their Lord 2, 3\.*  
* ***Evening Watch (ἑσπερινῇ φυλακῇ \- hesperinē phylakē):** This specific variant suggests a much more urgent and immediate context for the Parousia than the later canonical "second or third watch" 2, 3\.*

**12:46** ἥξει ὁ κύριος τοῦ **δούλου** ἐκείνου ἐν ἡμέρᾳ ᾗ οὐ προσδοκᾷ καὶ ἐν ὥρᾳ ᾗ οὐ γινώσκει, καὶ διχοτομήσει αὐτὸν καὶ τὸ μέρος αὐτοῦ μετὰ τῶν ἀπίστων θήσει 1\. **51** δοκεῖτε ὅτι εἰρήνην παρεγενόμην δοῦναι ἐν τῇ γῇ; οὐχί, λέγω ὑμῖν, ἀλλὰ **διαμερισμόν** 1\.**12:46** "The lord of that **slave** will come in a day when he does not expect and in an hour he does not know, and will cut him in two and appoint his portion with the unfaithful." 2 **51** "Do you think that I came to give peace on the earth? No, I tell you, but **division**" 2\.

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* ***Division (διαμερισμόν \- diamerismon):** This term represents the "shattering of the vessel" required to establish the Kingdom against the old order 2, 3\.*

**12:58** ὡς γὰρ ὑπάγεις μετὰ τοῦ ἀντιδίκου σου ἐπ᾽ ἄρχοντα... μήποτε κατασύρῃ σε πρὸς τὸν κριτὴν καὶ ὁ κριτὴς παραδώσει σε τῷ πράκτορι... **βαλεῖ** εἰς φυλακήν 1\. **59** λέγω σοι, οὐ μὴ ἐξέλθῃς ἐκεῖθεν ἕως καὶ ἀποδῷς τὸν ἔσχατον **κοδράντην** 1\.**12:58** "For as you go with your adversary before a ruler... lest he drag you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer... and he **cast** you into prison." 2 **59** "I tell you, you shall not come out from there until you have paid the last **quadrans**" 2\.

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* ***Cast (βαλεῖ):** The future tense is prioritized here, following the Marcionite attestation 2\.*  
* ***Quadrans (κοδράντην \- kodranten):** The reconstruction follows the variant in Marcion/Tertullian rather than the canonical "lepton," likely reflecting an earlier Roman legal context for the debt metaphor 2\.*
