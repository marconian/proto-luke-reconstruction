The following is the forensic reconstruction of the  **twentieth chapter** of **The Gospel** (Proto-Luke), which corresponds to the twenty-second chapter of the canonical text. This stratum is the "Passion Narrative" of the Jamesian Protograph.  
As established by the excision protocol, this text is stripped of the "Atonement" theology of the later Pauline-influenced layers and the physicalist interpolations designed to counter Gnosticism. The result is a narrative of eschatological transition and a martyr's resolve.

### THE GOSPEL (PROTO-LUKE): CHAPTER 20

**22:1** And the feast of  **unleavened bread**, the one called **Passover**, was drawing near. **2** And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how they might kill him; for they feared the people. **4** And Judas went away and spoke with the  **commanders** how he might deliver him to them. **5** And they were glad and agreed to give him silver.

* *Note on Unleavened Bread (τῶν ἀζύμων \- tōn azymōn): A dry forensic marker of the Jewish festival context preserved in the primitive source.*  
* *Note on the Omission of v. 3: The phrase "And Satan entered into Judas" is an interpolation not present in this stratum 1\. In the Protograph, the betrayal is a clinical legal transaction rather than a demonic possession.*  
* *Note on Commanders (στρατηγοῖς \- stratēgois): I have translated this literally to denote the temple police/officials, rather than the more generic "captains."*

**7** And the day of unleavened bread came... **8** And he sent Peter and the rest, saying, "Go and prepare the Passover for us, that we may eat." **14** And when the hour came, he **lay down**, and the twelve  **apostles** were with him. **15** And he said to them: "With desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer."

* *Note on Lay Down (ἀνέπεσε \- anepese): The literal term for reclining at the table, denoting a formal fellowship meal 2\.*  
* *Note on Apostles (ἀπόστολοι \- apostoloi): Retained here as "sent ones," the authorized agents of the movement.*

**16** \[The saying regarding not eating again is **Not Present** in this stratum 3, 4\].  
**17** And receiving a cup, having given thanks, he said: "Take this and divide it among yourselves." **18** "For I say to you, I will not drink from the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes." **19a** And taking bread, having given thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying: "**This is my body**."

* *Note on the Eucharist (vv. 19b–20): The "Short Form" of the meal is restored here. The words regarding the "new covenant in blood" and the "body given for you" are later interpolations (Western Non-Interpolations) intended to align the Gospel with Pauline atonement theology 5, 6\. The Protograph preserves a meal of eschatological anticipation.*

**21** "But behold, the hand of the one delivering me up is with mine on the table." **22** "For the **son of man** goes... but woe to that man through whom he is delivered up."

* *Note on the Omission of v. 22a: The phrase "according to that which has been determined" is absent, as the Protograph focuses on the clinical event rather than a predetermined cosmic script 7\.*

**24** And there was also a dispute among them, which of them seems to be greater. **25** But he said to them: "The kings of the nations exercise authority over them... **26** But you are not so; but let the greater among you be as the  **younger**, and the leader as the one  **serving**." **27** "For who is greater, the one  **laying down** or the one serving? Is it not the one laying down? But I am in your midst as the one serving."

* *Note on Younger (νεώτερος \- neōteros) and Serving (διακονῶν \- diakonōn): These terms define the "Rule of Reversal" within the Ebionite community.*  
* *Note on Laying Down (ἀνακείμενος \- anakeimenos): Again, the forensic term for the guest of honor reclining at the table.*

**28-30** \[The saying regarding "judging the twelve tribes of Israel" is  **Unattested** as a coherent part of this specific stratum 3\].  
**31** "Simon, Simon, behold,  **the adversary** has demanded to sift you like wheat." **32** "But I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail; and you, when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers." **33** But he said to him: "Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death." **34** But he said: "I say to you, Peter, a cock will not crow today until you have three times denied that you know me."

* *Note on The Adversary (ὁ Σατανᾶς \- ho Satanas): Translated here as "the adversary" to reflect the functional role of the prosecutor in the transition between aeons.*

**35-38** \[The "Two Swords" pericope is  **Not Present** in this stratum 4, 8\. Its removal eliminates the later attempt to portray the disciples as armed or to justify subsequent defensive violence\].  
**39** And going out, he went according to custom to the  **Mount of Olives**; and the disciples also followed him. **40** And coming to the place, he said to them: "Pray not to enter into temptation." **41** And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's throw, and placing his knees, he prayed, **42** saying: "Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done."

* *Note on the Omission of vv. 43–44: The narrative of the "angel from heaven" and the "sweat like drops of blood" is a later interpolation (absent in P75, א, and B). Its removal restores the Jamesian Christ of stoic resolve, facing death with spiritual confidence 9, 10\.*

**45** And rising from the prayer, coming to the disciples, he found them sleeping... **46** and said to them: "Why do you sleep? Rise and pray, that you may not enter into temptation."  
**47** And while he was still speaking, behold, a crowd, and the one called Judas... was going before them and he drew near to Jesus to kiss him. **48** But Jesus said to him: "Judas, do you deliver up the son of man with a kiss?"

* *Note on the Omission of vv. 49–51: The healing of the high priest's servant's ear is absent. This ensures the narrative focuses on the legal arrest rather than a miraculous interruption of justice 11, 12\.*

**52** And Jesus said to the chief priests and commanders of the temple and elders... "Have you come out as against a robber with swords and clubs?" **53** "While I was daily with you in the temple, you did not stretch out your hands against me; but this is your hour and the  **authority** of darkness."

* *Note on Authority (ἐξουσία \- exousia): Denotes the legal or delegated power permitted to the old order in its final hour.*

**54–62** \[The details of Peter's denial are summarized in this stratum as a singular clinical failure, omitting the later narrative elaborations 11\].  
**63** And the men who were holding him were mocking him, beating him. **64** And having blindfolded him, they were asking, saying: "Prophesy\! Who is the one who struck you?"  
**66** And as it became day, the assembly of the elders of the people was gathered... and they led him away into their **council**. **67** saying: "If you are the  **Christ**, tell us." But he said to them: "If I tell you, you will not believe." **70** And they all said: "Are you then the  **Son of God**?" And he said to them: "**You say it**."

* *Note on Council (συνέδριον \- synedrion): The specific legal body of the Jerusalem elite.*  
* *Note on the Christ (ὁ Χριστός) and Son of God (ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ θεοῦ): These are treated as functional titles in the trial, which Jesus accepts through the ambiguous, non-committal "You say it" (ὑμεῖς λέγετε) 13, 14\.*

**69** "But from now on the **son of man** shall be seated at the  **right hand of the power of God**."

* *Note on the Right Hand of the Power of God (ἐκ δεξιῶν τῆς δυνάμεως τοῦ θεοῦ): The definitive Jamesian/Pauline confession of spiritual resurrection and exaltation, occurring without the need for an empty tomb 15, 16\.*

### LITERARY COMMENTARY: THE MARTYR'S EUCHARIST

Chapter 20 of the Protograph provides the  **Anatomy of the Transition**.

1. **The Non-Atoning Meal:** By excising the "Atonement" additions (vv. 19b-20), the text reveals a meal where the focus is the "divide among yourselves" (v. 17). It is a ritual of communal solidarity and a "Kingdom Banquet" in miniature, rather than a mystery cult centered on blood sacrifice.  
2. **The Stoic Christ:** The removal of the "bloody sweat" (vv. 43-44) is essential. The Jamesian Jesus does not collapse in biological terror; he undergoes a "final separation" from the maternal/finite self with a resolve that models the conduct of the future martyrs of the Jerusalem church.  
3. **Spiritual Enthronement:** Verse 69 provides the climax of the chapter. The "Resurrection" is presented here not as a physical return to the old life, but as an immediate transition to the "Right Hand of Power." The forensic reality of the cross is the mechanism by which the Son of Man enters his spiritual state.
