The following is the forensic reconstruction of the **nineteenth chapter** of the **Jamesian Protograph** (Proto-Luke), which corresponds to the twenty-first chapter of the canonical text. This chapter comprises the "Little Apocalypse," providing the eschatological framework for the movement.  
A defining feature of this stratum is the absence of the post-70 CE "Armies surrounding Jerusalem" prophecy, which is restored here to its primitive, Danielic "Abomination of Desolation" form. Furthermore, the text reinforces the authority of the Messenger’s words over the material heavens and earth.

### THE GOSPEL (PROTO-LUKE): CHAPTER 19

**21:1** And looking up, he saw the rich casting their gifts into the **treasury**. **2** And he saw a certain poor widow casting in there two **lepta**. **3** And he said, "Truly I say to you, that this poor widow has cast in more than all." **4** "For all these out of their abundance cast into the gifts, but she out of her lack cast in all the living that she had."

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* **Treasury (γαζοφυλάκιον \- gazophylakion):** *The term identifies the economic heart of the Temple establishment, which the Jamesian community viewed as the center of "Mammon" 1, 2\.*  
* **Lepta (λεπτά):** *The smallest Greek copper coin; I have retained the literal term to emphasize the clinical economic reality of the "Poor" (Ebionim).*

**8** And he said, "Take heed that you be not **led astray**; for many shall come in my name, saying, '**I am the Christ**,' and the time has come near; do not go after them." **9** "And when you hear of wars and disturbances, do not be terrified; for these things must first happen, but the end is not immediately." **10** Then he said to them, "**Nation** shall rise against nation, and **kingdom** against kingdom." **11** "And there shall be great earthquakes, and in various places **pestilences and famines**; and there shall be terrors and great signs from heaven."

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* **Led astray (πλανηθῆτε \- planēthēte):** *A forensic warning against the corruption of the pneumatic path by false claimants 3, 4\.*  
* **I am the Christ (ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ Χριστός):** *This specific phrasing is found in the Marcionite layer (4.39.2), distancing the Messenger from those claiming localized, material messiahship 5\.*  
* **Pestilences and famines (λοιμοὶ καὶ λιμοὶ):** *The reconstruction follows the order found in the earliest witnesses (B, OL, sys), which was often inverted in later Byzantine manuscripts 6\.*

**12** "But before all these things, they shall lay their hands on you and **persecute** you, delivering you to the **synagogues** and prisons, being brought before kings and governors for my name's sake." **13** "And it shall result for you in a **testimony**." **15** "For I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all those opposing you will not be able to **resist or contradict**." **17** "And you will be hated by all for my name's sake." **19** "In your **patience** you will save yourselves."

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* **Persecute (διώξουσιν):** *The text treats persecution as a clinical certainty for the community of the Poor in the transition between aeons 7\.*  
* **Testimony (μαρτύριον \- martyrion):** *Not a legal defense, but a spiritual manifestation of the Truth against the "Rulers of this Age" 8\.*  
* **Resist or contradict (ἀντιστῆναι ἢ ἀντειπεῖν):** *The reconstruction preserves the rhythmic Lukan pairing found in the primitive stratum 9\.*  
* **Patience (ὑπομονῇ \- hypomonē):** *Better rendered as "patient endurance." The singular reading "save yourselves" (σώσετε ἑαυτούς) is attested in the Marcionite layer, focusing on the preservation of the pneumatic self 10\.*

**20** "But when you see the **abomination of desolation** standing where it ought not, then know that its **desolation** has come near."

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* **Abomination of Desolation (βδέλυγμα τῆς ἐρημώσεως):** *Critical forensic restoration. Canonical Luke 21:20 (post-70 CE) reads "surrounded by armies," but the Jamesian Protograph/Marcionite layer preserves the cryptic Danielic phrase also found in Mark 13:14 11, 12\. This functioned as the "Oracle" mentioned by Eusebius that warned the Jerusalem Church to flee to Pella before the circumvallation was complete 13, 14\.*

**25** "And there shall be signs in sun and moon and stars, and on the earth **distress** of nations in perplexity at the roar of the sea and the surging." **26** "Men fainting from fear and expectation of the things coming on the world; for the **powers** of the heavens shall be shaken." **27** "And then they shall see the **son of man** coming from the **heavens** with much power and glory." **28** "But when these things begin to happen, stand up and lift up your heads, because your **redemption** draws near."

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* **Distress (συνοχή \- synochē):** *Denotes a "constriction" or being hemmed in by the collapse of the old order 15\.*  
* **Powers (δυνάμεις):** *Refers to the pneumatic structures of the celestial realm 15\.*  
* **Heavens (οὐρανῶν):** *Tertullian (4.39.10) attests the plural "heavens," a variant that emphasizes the cosmic origin of the Son of Man 16\.*  
* **Redemption (ἀπολύτρωσις \- apolytrōsis):** *The clinical "loosing" or "releasing" of the community from the material debris of the age 7\.*

**29** And he spoke a parable to them: "Look at the fig tree and all the trees." **30** "When they already bring forth **fruit**, looking at them you know for yourselves that the **summer** is already near." **31** "So also you, when you see these things happening, know that the **kingdom of God** is near." **33** "The heaven and the earth shall pass away, but **my words** shall not pass away."

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* **Fruit (καρπόν):** *The inclusion of "fruit" (rather than just "leaves") is a characteristic of the "Western" and Marcionite text (D, d, sys), signifying the maturation of the work 17, 18\.*  
* **My words (οἱ λόγοι μου):** *In the Jamesian Protograph, the permanence of Jesus's specific words replaces the canonical emphasis on the "Law" (nomos), reflecting the transition to the new covenant of the Spirit 19, 20\.*

**34** "But take heed to yourselves, lest your hearts be weighed down with **debauchery** and drunkenness and the **anxieties** of this life, and that day come upon you suddenly as a **snare**." **37** And during the days he was teaching in the **Temple**, and during the nights he went out and lodged on the mountain called **Olives**. **38** And all the people came **early in the morning** to him in the Temple to listen to him.

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* **Debauchery (κραιπάλῃ \- kraipalē):** *Specifically refers to the nausea or "hangover" of material indulgence; the text treats sensory excess as a weight on the heart 21\.*  
* **Anxieties (μερίμναις):** *The "debris" of the mind 21\.*  
* **Temple (ἱερῷ):** *The stage for the final confrontation with the Sadducean elite 22\.*  
* **Early in the morning (ὤρθριζεν):** *A Lukanism preserved in the Protograph, denoting the urgency of the instruction before the Passion 22\.*

### Additional Explanation: The "Abomination" and the Pella Oracle

Chapter 19 of the Protograph is the **Manual of the Great Transition**.

1. **The Chronometer of Flight:** The most significant forensic detail is the restoration of **v. 20**. Canonical Luke was edited after 70 CE to make the prophecy conform to the Roman circumvallation ("surrounded by armies"). The Protograph, however, contains the "Abomination of Desolation"—the cryptic signal that allowed the Jerusalem community to flee to Pella **before** the city was locked. A prophecy given while the city is already surrounded would be clinically useless for flight 11-13.  
2. **The Supersession of Debris:** In **v. 33**, the Messenger asserts that his "words" are more permanent than the physical universe. This reflects a High Pneumatic Christology where the Spirit (the Word) is the only objective reality, and the material "heaven and earth" are merely temporary vessels.  
3. **The Law of Sobriety:** The warning against **kraipalē** (debauchery) and "anxieties of life" is a typical Jamesian exhortation. Discipleship in the Protograph requires an "unweighted" heart, free from the sensory debris of the world, to perceive the coming redemption 21, 23\.
