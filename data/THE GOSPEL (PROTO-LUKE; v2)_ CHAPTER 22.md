### THE GOSPEL (PROTO-LUKE): CHAPTER 22

This concluding chapter of the **Jamesian Protograph** (Proto-Luke) represents the primitive record of the **spiritual manifestation** (*Soma Pneumatikon*) of the Messenger 1, 2\. Unlike the later canonical expansion, this stratum is defined by the "Western Non-Interpolations"—shorter readings that lack the secondary physicalist "proofs" (flesh, bones, and eating) added in the second century to combat Gnosticism 3-5. The narrative emphasizes the ambiguity of the tomb and the restoration of the community’s internal sight through the opening of the **mind** (*nous*) 2, 6\.  
**24:1** Τῇ δὲ μιᾷ τῶν σαββάτων ὄρθρου βαθέως ἐπὶ τὸ μνῆμα ἦλθον φέρουσαι ἃ ἡτοίμασαν ἀρώματα. **2** εὗρον δὲ τὸν λίθον ἀποκεκυλισμένον ἀπὸ τοῦ μνημείου, **3** εἰσελθοῦσαι δὲ οὐχ εὗρον τὸ σῶμα. **4** καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ ἀπορεῖσθαι αὐτὰς περὶ τούτου καὶ ἰδοὺ ἄνδρες δύο ἐπέστησαν αὐταῖς ἐν ἐσθῆτι **ἀστραπτούσῃ**. **5** ἐμφόβων δὲ γενομένων αὐτῶν καὶ κλινουσῶν τὰ πρόσωπα εἰς τὴν γῆν εἶπαν πρὸς αὐτάς· Τί ζητεῖτε τὸν ζῶντα μετὰ τῶν νεκρῶν; **6** ...μνήσθητε ὡς ἐλάλησεν ὑμῖν ἔτι ὢν ἐν τῇ Γαλιλαίᾳ, **7** λέγων **τὸν υἱὸν τοῦ ἀνθρώπου** ὅτι δεῖ παραδοθῆναι εἰς χεῖρας ἀνθρώπων ἁμαρτωλῶν καὶ σταυρωθῆναι καὶ τῇ τρίτῃ ἡμέρᾳ ἀναστῆναι. **8** καὶ ἐμνήσθησαν τῶν ῥημάτων αὐτοῦ. **9** καὶ ὑποστρέψασαι ἀπὸ τοῦ μνημείου ἀπήγγειλαν ταῦτα πάντα τοῖς ἕνδεκα καὶ πᾶσιν τοῖς λοιποῖς. **11** καὶ ἐφάνησαν ἐνώπιον αὐτῶν ὡσεὶ λῆρος τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα, καὶ ἠπίστουν αὐταῖς.  
**24:1** On the first day of the Sabbaths, at deep dawn, they came to the tomb bringing the spices they had prepared. **2** They found the stone rolled away from the tomb. **3** Entering, they did not find the body. **4** It happened while they were perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in **flashing clothes**. **5** As they were afraid and bowed their faces to the ground, they said to them, "Why do you seek the living with the dead? **6** ...Remember how he spoke to you while still in Galilee, **7** saying that it is necessary for the **son of man** to be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and on the third day to rise." **8** And they remembered his words. **9** Returning from the tomb, they reported all these things to the eleven and to all the rest. **11** These words seemed to them as nonsense, and they did not believe them.

* *Notes on the Tomb Manifestation:*  
* **Body (σῶμα \- sōma):** *The primitive stratum omits "of the Lord Jesus" (found in canonical Luke). This is a "Western Non-Interpolation" where the shorter text reflects the original clinical observation of a missing corpse 7-9.*  
* **Flashing clothes (ἀστραπτούσῃ \- astraptousē):** *This denotes a radiance characteristic of pneumatic manifestations rather than a material person. It aligns with the visionary sensory overload found in the prophets 10, 11\.*  
* **Omission of 24:6a:** *The specific proclamation "He is not here, but has been raised" is absent in the Western text (Codex Bezae) and the Marcionite witnesses. In Proto-Luke, the tomb remains an ambiguous sign of absence, prompting memory (anamnesis) rather than offering forensic proof 11, 12\.*  
* **Son of Man (τὸν υἱὸν τοῦ ἀνθρώπου):** *Used here as the clinical referent for the Messenger's eschatological role 13\.*  
* **Nonsense (λῆρος \- lēros):** *The report of the women is dismissed as an "idle tale" or "delirium," emphasizing that the empty tomb did not generate faith in the earliest community 13, 14\.*  
* **Excision of 24:12:** *The account of Peter running to the tomb is a secondary interpolation found in the Alexandrian tradition but absent in the Western and Marcionite layers 11, 15, 16\.*

**24:13** Καὶ ἰδοὺ δύο ἐξ αὐτῶν ἐν αὐτῇ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἦσαν πορευόμενοι εἰς κώμην ἀπέχουσαν σταδίους ἑξήκοντα ἀπὸ Ἰερουσαλήμ, ᾗ ὄνομα Ἐμμαοῦς. **15** ...καὶ αὐτὸς Ἰησοῦς ἐγγίσας συνεπορεύετο αὐτοῖς, **16** οἱ δὲ ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτῶν **ἐκρατοῦντο** τοῦ μὴ ἐπιγνῶναι αὐτόν. **19** ...τὰ περὶ Ἰησοῦ τοῦ Ναζωραίου, ὃς ἐγένετο ἀνὴρ προφήτης δυνατὸς ἐν ἔργῳ καὶ λόγῳ ἐναντίον τοῦ θεοῦ καὶ παντὸς τοῦ λαοῦ. **30** καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ κατακλιθῆναι αὐτὸν μετ' αὐτῶν λαβὼν τὸν ἄρτον εὐλόγησεν καὶ κλάσας ἐπεδίδου αὐτοῖς· **31** αὐτῶν δὲ διηνοίχθησαν οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ καὶ ἐπέγνωσαν αὐτόν· καὶ αὐτὸς **ἄφαντος** ἐγένετο ἀπ' αὐτῶν. **32** καὶ εἶπαν πρὸς ἀλλήλους· Οὐχὶ ἡ καρδία ἡμῶν καιομένη ἦν... ὡς διήνοιγεν ἡμῖν τὰς γραφάς;  
**24:13** Behold, two of them on that same day were going to a village sixty stadia from Jerusalem, called **Emmaus**. **15** ...Jesus himself drew near and went with them. **16** But their eyes **were held** so they did not recognize him. **19** ...The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who was a man, a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people. **30** And it happened that when he reclined with them, taking the bread, he blessed and, breaking it, he gave it to them. **31** Their eyes were opened, and they recognized him; and he became **invisible** to them. **32** And they said to one another: "Was not our heart burning... as he opened the scriptures to us?"

* *Notes on the Road Manifestation:*  
* **Were held (ἐκρατοῦντο \- ekratounto):** *This implies a psychological or pneumatic constraint. The "Resurrected" one is only recognizable through spiritual volition 17\.*  
* **Invisible (ἄφαντος \- aphantos):** *Literally "vanishing" or "becoming un-manifest." This is the technical term for the cessation of a pneumatic manifestation, proving that the body did not adhere to material laws 6, 18\.*  
* **Opening of Scriptures:** *Faith in the Jamesian Protograph is generated through the "Opening of the Word" rather than the inspection of a body 19, 20\.*

**24:36** Ταῦτα δὲ αὐτῶν λαλούντων αὐτὸς ἔστη ἐν μέσῳ αὐτῶν καὶ λέγει αὐτοῖς· Εἰρήνη ὑμῖν. **37** πτοηθέντες δὲ καὶ ἔμφοβοι γενόμενοι ἐδόκουν **πνεῦμα** θεωρεῖν. **38** καὶ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς· Τί τεταραγμένοι ἐστὲ καὶ διὰ τί διαλογισμοὶ ἀναβαίνουσιν ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ ὑμῶν; **39** ἴδετε τὰς χεῖράς μου καὶ τοὺς πόδας μου ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι αὐτός... **44** Εἶπεν δὲ πρὸς αὐτούς· Οὗτοι οἱ λόγοι μου οὓς ἐλάλησα πρὸς ὑμᾶς ἔτι ὢν σὺν ὑμῖν, ὅτι δεῖ πληρωθῆναι πάντα τὰ γεγραμμένα ἐν τῷ νόμῳ Μωϋσέως καὶ τοῖς προφήταις καὶ ψαλμοῖς περὶ ἐμοῦ. **45** τότε διήνοιξεν αὐτῶν τὸν **νοῦν** τοῦ συνιέναι τὰς γραφάς. **47** ...κηρυχθῆναι ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι αὐτοῦ μετάνοιαν εἰς ἄφεσιν ἁμαρτιῶν εἰς πάντα τὰ ἔθνη. **48** ὑμεῖς μάρτυρες τούτων. **51** καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ εὐλογεῖν αὐτὸν αὐτοὺς **διέστη** ἀπ' αὐτῶν. **52** ...ὑπέστρεψαν εἰς Ἰερουσαλήμ μετὰ χαρᾶς μεγάλης, **53** καὶ ἦσαν διὰ παντὸς ἐν τῷ **ἱερῷ** αἰνοῦντες καὶ εὐλογοῦντες τὸν θεόν.  
**24:36** While they were saying these things, he himself stood in the midst of them and said: "Peace to you." **37** But being terrified and afraid, they thought they were seeing a **spirit**. **38** And he said to them: "Why are you troubled, and why do debates arise in your hearts?" **39** "See my hands and my feet, that it is **I myself**..." **44** And he said to them: "These are my words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that it is necessary for all things written in the law of Moses and the prophets and psalms about me to be fulfilled." **45** Then he opened their **mind** to understand the scriptures. **47** ...and that repentance into forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all the nations. **48** You are witnesses of these things. **51** And it happened while he was blessing them, he **parted** from them. **52** ...they returned to Jerusalem with great joy, **53** and they were continually in the **Temple** praising and blessing God.

* *Notes on the Final Separation and Mind:*  
* **Spirit (πνεῦμα \- pneuma):** *The text records the default perception of the witnesses—that they were seeing a non-corporeal entity 2, 21, 22\.*  
* **Excision of 24:39b–43:** *The claims of "flesh and bones" and the act of eating fish are omitted as late anti-Docetic additions. They were designed to materialize the resurrection in direct contradiction to the earlier Jamesian/Pauline teaching that "flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom" 2, 4, 5, 19, 22\.*  
* **I myself (ἐγώ εἰμι αὐτός):** *Jesus provides identity markers (the wounds) to confirm personhood without implying a resuscitated corpse 22\.*  
* **Mind (νοῦν \- noun):** *The climax of the Protograph is intellectual and pneumatic enlightenment—the transition from sensory debris to internal understanding 2, 23\.*  
* **Parted (διέστη \- diestē):** *The original text lacks the physical levitation/ascension into the sky ("carried up into heaven" is a Western Non-Interpolation). The vision simply ceases 2, 24, 25\.*  
* **Temple (ἱερῷ \- hierō):** *The narrative ends in the Temple, anchoring the movement as a legitimate Judean institution (the "Opposition Priesthood") in Jerusalem 2, 20, 26\.*
