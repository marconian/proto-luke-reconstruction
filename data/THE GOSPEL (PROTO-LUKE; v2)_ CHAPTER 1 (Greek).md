### THE GOSPEL (PROTO-LUKE): CHAPTER 1 (Greek Reconstruction)

**1** Ἐν ἔτει δὲ πεντεκαιδεκάτῳ τῆς ἡγεμονίας Τιβερίου Καίσαρος, ἡγεμονεύοντος Ποντίου Πιλάτου τῆς Ἰουδαίας, καὶ τετρααρχοῦντος τῆς Γαλιλαίας Ἡρῴδου, Φιλίππου δὲ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ τετρααρχοῦντος τῆς Ἰτουραίας καὶ Τραχωνίτιδος χώρας, καὶ Λυσανίου τῆς Ἀβειληνῆς τετρααρχοῦντος, 1-3. **2** καὶ κατῆλθεν εἰς Καφαρναοὺμ πόλιν τῆς Γαλιλαίας. καὶ ἦν διδάσκων αὐτοὺς ἐν τοῖς σάββασιν· 1, 2, 4\. **3** καὶ ἐξεπλήσσοντο ἐπὶ τῇ διδαχῇ αὐτοῦ, ὅτι ἐν ἐξουσίᾳ ἦν ὁ λόγος αὐτοῦ 1, 2\.  
*Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*

* **Governance (ἡγεμονίας \- hēgemonias):** *I have used "governance" to reflect the clinical administrative nature of the Roman office, stripping away the theological weight often assigned to "reign" 5\.*  
* **Came down (κατῆλθεν \- katēlthen):** *This verb functions as the forensic starting point for the Jamesian community, indicating a pneumatic descent into the historical timeline without the biological mediation of a birth narrative 4, 5\.*  
* **Authority (ἐξουσίᾳ \- exousia):** *The source emphasizes the immediate impact of the Word, which overrides the traditional debris of the established elite 1, 5\.*  
* **Omission of 1:1–2:52:** *The "Pastoral" prologue and birth narratives are excised entirely in this stratum, as they were later additions designed to anchor the narrative in Davidic biology 6-8.*  
* **Omission of 3:1b–4:13:** *The baptism by John and the testing in the wilderness are absent; this reflects a Christology where the Messenger requires no validation from the prophets of the old aeon 4, 5, 9\.*

**4** Καὶ ἦλθεν εἰς Ναζαρά, οὗ ἦν τεθραμμένος, καὶ εἰσῆλθεν κατὰ τὸ εἰωθὸς αὐτῷ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῶν σαββάτων εἰς τὴν συναγωγήν, καὶ ἀνέστη ἀναγνῶναι 1, 10, 11\. **5** καὶ πάντες ἐμαρτύρουν αὐτῷ καὶ ἐθαύμαζον ἐπὶ τοῖς λόγοις τῆς χάριτος τοῖς ἐκπορευομένοις ἐκ τοῦ στόματος αὐτοῦ 1, 10\. **6** καὶ εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτούς· πάντως ἐρεῖτέ μοι τὴν παραβολὴν ταύτην· ἰατρέ, θεράπευσον σεαυτόν· ὅσα ἠκούσαμεν γενόμενα εἰς τὴν Καφαρναοὺμ ποίησον καὶ ὧδε ἐν τῇ πατρίδι σου 1, 10, 11\.  
*Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*

* **Relocation (Luke 4:16–30):** *In the Jamesian Protograph, narrative logic is restored by placing the Nazareth visit after the Capernaum ministry. Forensic analysis shows "editorial fatigue" in the canonical text, where a crowd in Nazareth mentions miracles in Capernaum before the Messenger has actually visited that city 5, 10, 11\.*  
* **Assembly (συναγωγήν \- synagōgēn):** *I have used "assembly" for synagōgēn to maintain the literal sense of a gathering place 5\.*  
* **Excision of Biological Paternity (4:22):** *The phrase "Is this not Joseph's son?" is absent in the earliest witnesses. Its removal aligns with a pneumatic Christology based on power rather than biological descent 4, 5\.*  
* **Healer (ἰατρέ \- iatre):** *I have used "healer" to reflect the functional role of restoration in the material ultimates of the community 1\.*
