The following is the forensic reconstruction of the sixth chapter of the **Jamesian Protograph** (Proto-Luke). This section moves from the crossing of the lake into the confrontation with the "Legion" and the miraculous preservation of the poor, concluding with the feeding of the multitude.  
In this stratum, the narrative emphasizes the "Divine Human in Ultimates" through the specific exercise of authority over non-physical spirits (*πνεύματα*) and the material needs of the community 1\.

### THE GOSPEL (PROTO-LUKE): CHAPTER 6

**8:26** And they sailed down to the region of the **Gerasenes**, which is over against Galilee. **27** And when he went out upon the land, a certain man from the city met him who had **messengers** spirits for a long time. **30** And Jesus asked him: "What is your name?" and he said, "**Legion**," because many messengers had entered into him. **31** And they were begging him that he would not command them to go away into the **abyss**. **32** Now there was a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain; and they begged him to allow them to enter into those. And he allowed them. **33** And the messengers, coming out from the man, entered into the swine, and the herd rushed down the cliff into the lake and were drowned.

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* **Gerasenes (Γερασηνῶν \- Gerasēnōn):** *The source text exhibits variation between Gerasenes, Gadarenes, and Gergesenes 2\. Gerasenes is the most likely early reading for this stratum 3\.*  
* **Messengers (δαιμόνια \- daimonia):** *Translated literally as functional entities, avoiding the later religious weight of "demons" Source instructions.*  
* **Abyss (ἄβυσσον \- abysson):** *A specific Jamesian/Ebionite term for the place of disorder. The spirits recognize Jesus's authority to impose order over the "chaos" of the material world 4, 5\.*

**40** And it happened, when Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed him, for they were all expecting him. **41** And behold, there came a man whose name was **Jairus**, and he was a ruler of the assembly; and falling at the feet of Jesus, he was begging him to enter into his house. **42** For he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying. **44** A woman coming up behind, touched the **fringe** of his garment, and immediately the flow of her blood stopped. **45** And Jesus said: "**Who touched me?**" **46** But Jesus said: "**Someone touched me, for I knew power going out from me.**" **48** And he said to her: "Daughter, your faith has saved you; go in peace."

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* **Fringe (κρασπέδου \- kraspedou):** *While some sources view this as a later addition, it is retained here as a marker of the "Divine Human in Ultimates"—where physical contact with the "ultimate" (the garment) results in a spiritual effect (healing) 3, 6\.*  
* **Power (δύναμιν \- dynamin):** *This refers to the "Divine Influx." The Savior's body acts as a conduit for the restoration of the inner person 3, 4\.*

**9:1** And calling together the **twelve**, he gave them power and authority over all the messengers and to heal diseases. **2** And he sent them to announce the **kingdom of God** and to heal. **3** And he said to them: "Take nothing for the road, neither **staff**, nor scrip, nor bread, nor silver, nor to have two tunics." **5** "And as many as do not receive you, going out from that city, shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against them." **6** And going out, they were going through the villages, announcing the good news and healing everywhere.

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* **Kingdom of God (βασιλείαν τοῦ θεοῦ):** *A central Jamesian pillar. The mission is not personal salvation, but the announcement of a new ethical order 1\.*  
* **Staff (ῥάβδον \- rabdon):** *The omission of the staff is a specific Marcionite variant (aligning with Luke 10:4), intended to emphasize total reliance on the Divine Influx rather than physical support 7, 8\.*

**7** Now Herod the tetrarch heard all the things happening, and he was perplexed... **8** ...because it was said by some that **Elijah** had appeared, and by others that a **prophet**, one of the ancients, had risen. **10** And the messengers, having returned, described to him as many things as they had done. **12** And the day began to decline... he was in a **desert place**. **13** But he said to them: "You give them something to eat." And they said: "There are not to us more than **five loaves and two fishes**." **14** For they were about **five thousand men**. **16** And taking the five loaves and the two fishes, looking up into the heaven, he **blessed** them and broke them. **17** And they ate and were all satisfied.

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* **Desert place (ἔρημον τόπον):** *Consistent with the Jamesian/Essene "wilderness" theology. The feeding of the five thousand serves as a manifestation of "Divine Providence" for the Ebionim (the Poor) 9, 10\.*  
* **Blessed (εὐλόγησεν \- eulogēsen):** *The Adamantius Dialogue occasionally confuses this with "gave thanks" (εὐχαριστεῖ), but "blessed" is the more secure Jamesian reading, reflecting authority over the substance of the bread 10, 11\.*

### Additional Explanation: The Mechanics of Provision

Chapter 6 of the Jamesian Protograph establishes the movement's power over both the seen and unseen "Ultimates" of the world.

1. **The Casting out of Legion:** This pericope demonstrates the "Divine Bricolage" 12\. Jesus does not argue with the spirits; he imposes divine order upon them. The move into the swine and the subsequent drowning represents the "vastation" of the chaotic self-love (*proprium*) that leads to destruction 13\.  
2. **The Physical Proofs:** The healings in this chapter (the leper, the woman with the hemorrhage, Jairus’s daughter) are not mere magic. They are presented as "external confirmations of his authority to heal the soul" 14\. By touching the fringe or the hand of a dying girl, the Divine Human grounds his spiritual authority in material reality 15, 16\.  
3. **The Non-Interpolation:** Following verse 9:17, Proto-Luke exhibits the "Great Omission," skipping the material found in Mark 6:45–8:26 (walking on water, etc.). This confirms that Proto-Luke is an independent, coherent narrative that does not rely on Markan scaffolding, but preserves a distinct Jerusalem tradition 17\.  
4. **The Feeding of the Poor:** The feeding of the five thousand is the "smoking gun" of Ebionite provision 18\. It reinforces the belief that the "Actual Jesus" is the true locus of God's presence on earth, replacing the lost Temple as the source of life and sustenance 9\.
