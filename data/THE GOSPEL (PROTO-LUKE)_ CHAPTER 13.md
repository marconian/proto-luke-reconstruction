The following is the forensic reconstruction of the thirteenth chapter of **The Gospel** (Proto-Luke), which corresponds to the fifteenth chapter of the canonical text. This stratum is characterized by the "Parables of the Lost," focusing on the recovery of the marginalized (the *Ebionim*).  
Significantly, the most famous pericope of the canonical chapter—the Parable of the Prodigal Son (15:11–32)—is entirely absent from this layer, as verified by both the silence of Tertullian and the explicit notes of Epiphanius 1-3.

### THE GOSPEL (PROTO-LUKE): CHAPTER 13

**15:1** Now all the tax-collectors and the **sinners** were coming near to him to listen to him 4\. **2** And the Pharisees and the scribes were grumbling, saying: "This man receives sinners and eats with them" 4\.

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* **Sinners (ἁμαρτωλοί \- hamartōloi):** *In the Jamesian context, this term often identifies those outside the strict purity regulations of the Temple elite, here being brought into the new communal "use" 5\.*

**4** "What man among you, having a hundred **sheep** and having lost one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the desert and go after the one having been lost until he finds it?" 6, 7\. **5** "And having found it, he places it upon his shoulders, rejoicing" 6, 7\. **6** "And coming into the house, he calls together the friends and the neighbors, saying to them: 'Rejoice with me, for I found my sheep which was lost'" 6, 7\. **7** "I say to you that so there shall be joy in the heaven over one sinner repenting" 7, 8\.

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* **Sheep (πρόβατα \- probata):** *Translated literally. The forensic analogy emphasizes the specific labor of the seeker to restore the lost element of the flock 6\.*  
* **Joy in the heaven (χαρὰ ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ):** *The reconstruction follows the more direct pneumatic reading. Some sources suggest the later addition of "messengers" (angels) was absent in the Jamesian Protograph, with the joy occurring directly before the Father 8\.*

**8** "Or what woman having ten **drachmas**, if she should lose one drachma, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek carefully until she finds it?" 6, 7\. **9** "And having found it, she calls together the friends and neighbors, saying: 'Rejoice with me, for I found the drachma which I lost'" 6, 7\. **10** "So, I say to you, there is joy before God over one sinner repenting" 7, 8\.

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* **Drachmas (δραχμάς \- drachmas):** *Greek silver coins. The loss of a material "ultimate" (the coin) serves as a dry fact to illustrate the value of the individual within the community of the poor 6\.*  
* **Before God (ἐνώπιον τοῦ θεοῦ):** *Consistent with the prior verse, the mention of "messengers" (angels) is unattested here in the primitive stratum. The "joy" is a direct result of the Divine Influx recognizing the return to order 8\.*

**15:11–32** The Parable of the Two Sons (the Prodigal Son) is **Not Present** in this stratum 1, 2, 7\.

### Additional Explanation: The Omission of the Prodigal

The absence of the "Prodigal Son" (15:11–32) is one of the most distinctive features of the Proto-Lukan/Marcionite stratum 1, 2\.

1. **The Context of Omission:** While later orthodoxy valued the parable for its theme of repentance, the Jamesian community likely viewed the narrative as a later harmonization. The story of a younger son "squandering property" and then being restored to a wealthy father's house does not align with the strict **Ebionite** (poverty) theology found elsewhere in the Protograph.  
2. **Structural Integrity:** Without verses 11–32, the chapter remains a coherent unit focused on the "Search and Recovery" mechanics of the Kingdom (the Sheep and the Coin). The transition from the finding of the coin directly into the stewardship parables of Chapter 14 (Proto-Luke 12\) is seamless, avoiding the lengthy narrative detour of the Prodigal 9, 10\.  
3. **The Anti-Harmonization Rule:** The "Prodigal Son" exhibits signs of being an "L" source expansion designed to provide a more domestic, less radical entry point into the movement, which was later incorporated during the transition from Proto-Luke to the canonical edition 10, 11\. In the Jamesian Protograph, the focus remains clinical: the restoration of the "lost" is a functional necessity of the Spirit, not a family drama 12\.
