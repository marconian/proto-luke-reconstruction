The following is the forensic reconstruction of the twelfth chapter of the **Jamesian Protograph** (Proto-Luke), which corresponds to the fourteenth chapter of the canonical text 1\. This section contains the core ethical directives regarding communal meals, the parabolic rejection of the institutional elite, and the absolute requirements for entry into the community of the *Ebionim* (The Poor) 2\.

### THE GOSPEL (PROTO-LUKE): CHAPTER 12

**14:1–11** \[The narrative concerning the healing of the man with dropsy and the teaching on choosing the lowest place is **Unattested** in this stratum 3.\]  
**12** Then he said also to the one who invited him, "When you make a **dinner** or a **banquet**, do not **call** your friends, nor your brothers, nor your kinsmen, nor rich neighbors." **14** "For they **have not** the means to repay you; but it shall be repaid to you in the **resurrection**."

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* **Dinner/Banquet (ἄριστον / δεῖπνον \- ariston / deipnon):** *The Greek distinguishes between a midday meal and a formal evening banquet; the instruction targets the entire social economy of reciprocity 3, 4\.*  
* **Call (φώνει \- phōnei):** *I have used the literal "call" to denote a formal invitation to a social contract 3\.*  
* **Have not (οὐκ ἔχουσιν \- ouk echousin):** *Tertullian’s Latin (non possint) likely renders this Lukan reading, focusing on the economic inability of the poor to maintain the "Old Aeon" cycle of debt and favor 3, 5\.*  
* **Resurrection (ἀναστάσει \- anastasei):** *The text omits the later qualifying "of the righteous," focusing on the event of restoration itself as the point of ultimate compensation 5\.*

**16** A certain man made a **banquet** and **called** many. **17** And he sent his **slave** at the hour of the banquet to say to those who were invited, "Come, for it is now ready." **18** And they all began to excuse themselves. The first said to him, "I bought a field, and I must go out and see it; I ask you, have me excused." **19** And another said, "I bought five pairs of oxen, and I am going to prove them; I ask you, have me excused." **20** And another said, "I married a wife, and therefore I cannot come."

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* **Banquet (δεῖπνον):** *The reconstruction omits "great" (μέγα), which is absent in several early witnesses including X, 213, and the Marcionite layer 3, 6\.*  
* **Slave (δοῦλον \- doulon):** *Per the translation philosophy, "slave" is used to reflect the total subordination within the household hierarchy Translation Philosophy, 1744\.*  
* **Excuse themselves (παραιτεῖσθαι):** *The excuses focus on property (fields), labor (oxen), and biological family (wife), all of which are the primary obstacles to the Jamesian community 7, 8\.*

**21** So that **slave** came and reported these things to his lord. Then the **master of the house**, being angry, said to his **slave**, "Go out quickly into the squares and streets of the city, and bring in here the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind." **22** And the **slave** said, "Lord, it is done as you commanded, and there is still **place**." **23** And the lord said to the **slave**, "Go out into the roads and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled." **24** "For I say to you, that none of those men who were invited shall taste of my banquet."

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* **Master of the house (οἰκοδεσπότης \- oikodespotēs):** *This term denotes the functional authority of the household, a central figure in the Jamesian parables of stewardship 8, 9\.*  
* **Place (τόπος \- topos):** *This refers to the spatial reality of the Kingdom; there is always "place" for the marginalized within the new social order 8\.*  
* **Compel (ἀνάγκασον):** *The command signifies the urgency of the gathering of the Ebionim as the old institutional invitations are nullified 8\.*

**26** "If anyone comes to me and does not **hate** his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, and even his own life also, he cannot be my disciple."

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* **Hate (μισεί \- misei):** *I have retained the stark "hate" found in the Proto-Lukan/Marcionite layer, rejecting any attempts to soften it to "love less," as it represents the radical asceticism of the Jerusalem Pillars 2, 10\.*

**33** "So therefore, any one of you who does not renounce **all that he has** cannot be my disciple."

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* **All that he has (πᾶσιν τοῖς ὑπάρχουσιν αὐτοῦ):** *This is the "smoking gun" of Ebionite communalism; discipleship in the Jamesian Protograph is contingent upon the total liquidation of private property for the benefit of the community of use 2, 7\.*

### Additional Explanation: The Economy of the Kingdom

Chapter 12 of the Protograph articulates the movement's **Socio-Economic Constitution**.

1. **The Abolition of Reciprocity:** By forbidding invitations to those who can "repay," Jesus severs the community from the Roman system of *patronage*. The "Resurrection" serves as the only valid transaction point 3, 5\.  
2. **The Rejection of Debris:** The excuses offered in the Parable of the Banquet (14:18-20) are the "material attachments" of the material world—land, capital (oxen), and biological lineage. The "Master" (the Spirit) identifies these as the primary inhibitors of divine power 7, 8\.  
3. **The Call to the Margin:** The filling of the house with the "maimed" and "blind" is the clinical manifestation of the **Theology of Reversal**. The "Poor" are not an object of charity but the very substance of the Kingdom 2, 11\.  
4. **The Law of Hate:** The command to "hate" one’s family (14:26) is a forensic requirement to detach the self from self-centered attachments mediated through biological ties, ensuring absolute loyalty to the Messenger 10, 12\.
