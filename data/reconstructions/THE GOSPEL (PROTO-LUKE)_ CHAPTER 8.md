The following is a revised forensic reconstruction of the eighth chapter of the **Jamesian Protograph** (Proto-Luke) 1, 2\. This revision acknowledges the lack of "editorial fatigue" in the Marcionite witnesses, which identifies the shorter text not as a "mutilated" version of Luke, but as the primitive, coherent source upon which the canonical author later expanded 3-5. Consequently, variants once labeled "pro-Gnostic edits" are restored here as the original readings of the Jerusalem community, reflecting their unique pneumatic and ethical priorities 6-8.

### THE GOSPEL (PROTO-LUKE): CHAPTER 8

**10:1** After these things the Lord appointed **seventy** others and sent them two by two before his face into every city and place where he himself was about to come turn 8\. **2** And he said to them: "The harvest indeed is great, but the laborers are few; beg then the Lord of the harvest that he might send laborers into his harvest" turn 8\. **3** "Go\! Behold, I send you as lambs in the midst of wolves" turn 8\. **4** "Carry no bag, no scrip, no sandals; and salute no one by the road" turn 8\.

* *Note on the **Seventy**: This number corresponds to the traditional count of the nations, indicating the Proto-Lukan mission was intended as a universal expansion of the Jamesian authority from its center in Jerusalem turn 8, 2208\.*  
* *Note on the Sandals: The prohibition of **sandals** (ὑποδήματα \- hypodēmata) is an original ascetic requirement of the Jamesian Protograph, emphasizing total reliance on the Divine Influx within the material world turn 8, 2181\.*

**9** "...And heal the sick in it, and say to them: 'The kingdom of God has come near upon you'" turn 8\. **10** "But into whatever city you enter and they do not receive you, going out into its streets, say: **11** 'Even the dust from your city having been joined to our feet we wipe off to you; nevertheless, know this, that the kingdom of God has come near'" turn 8\. **16** "The one listening to you listens to me, and the one rejecting you rejects me; and the one rejecting me rejects him who sent me" turn 8\.

* *Note on **Rejecting** (ἀθετῶν \- athetōn): The term denotes the forensic nullification of the messenger’s authority turn 8\. As the Jamesian community acted as an "Opposition Priesthood," the rejection of their emissaries was viewed as a rejection of the Divine Human in ultimates 7, 9\.*

**21** In that hour he rejoiced in the spirit and said: "I confess to you, Father, Lord of **heaven**, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to infants; yes, Father, for so it was well-pleasing before you" turn 8\. **22** "All things were delivered to me by my Father; and no one knows who the Father is except the Son, and who the Son is except the Father, and to whom the Son should reveal him" turn 8\.

* *Note on the **Lord of Heaven**: The omission of "and earth" (καὶ τῆς γῆς) is not a Gnostic excision but the original reading of the Protograph, distinguishing the spiritual source of life from the material environment turn 8, 2080\.*  
* *Note on the Inversion: The word order "no one knows who the Father is except the Son" is the primitive sequence of revelation turn 8\. This highlights the pneumatic gatekeeping of the Son, an essential component of the early Jerusalem tradition before it was smoothed over by later canonical editors 10, 11\.*

**25** And behold, a certain **lawyer** stood up, tempting him, saying: "Teacher, what doing shall I inherit life?" turn 8\. **26** He said to him: "In the Law what is written? How do you read?" turn 8\. **27** He answering said: "You shall love the Lord your God from all your heart and from all your soul and from all your strength and from all your mind" turn 8\. **28** And he said to him: "You answered correctly; **do** this and you shall live" turn 8\.

* *Note on **Doing** (ποίει \- poiei): This imperative underscores the Jamesian "Epistemology of Use," where eternal life is contingent upon active loyalty to the Law of Love (Ma'asim) rather than mere intellectual assent 7, 12\.*  
* *Note on the **Lawyer** (νομικός \- nomikos): The interaction represents an internal debate within the Hebrew community regarding the fulfillment of the Torah turn 8, 2242\.*

### LITERARY COMMENTARY: THE ABSENCE OF FATIGUE

The textual integrity of this chapter in the Proto-Lukan stratum proves that the shorter Marcionite text is the original 3, 4\. In canonical Luke, the transition between the mission of the seventy and the lawyer’s question often exhibits "editorial fatigue," where the vocabulary shifts to match the Matthean or Markan parallels 3, 13\. In this reconstruction, the Jamesian voice is consistent, focusing on the authority of the "Sent Ones" (messengers) and the necessity of fulfilling the Law through action 11, 14\. The variants in verses 21 and 22 are the bedrock of the earliest Christology, presenting a Savior who is the sole source of knowledge for a previously unknown Father turn 8, 2173\.
