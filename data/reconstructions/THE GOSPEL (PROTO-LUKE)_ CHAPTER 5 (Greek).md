### THE GOSPEL (PROTO-LUKE): CHAPTER 5 (Greek)

**8:1** Καὶ ἐγένετο ἐν τῷ καθεξῆς καὶ αὐτὸς διώδευεν κατὰ πόλιν καὶ κώμην κηρύσσων καὶ εὐαγγελιζόμενος τὴν βασιλείαν τοῦ θεοῦ, καὶ οἱ δώδεκα σὺν αὐτῷ, **2** καὶ γυναῖκές τινες... **3** αἵτινες διηκόνουν αὐτῷ ἐκ τῶν **ὑπαρχόντων** αὐταῖς.

* *Notes on Greek Text and Reconstruction:*  
* **εὐαγγελιζόμενος (euangelizomenos):** *The Greek identifies the Messenger’s primary function as an announcer or herald of a new governance 1\. In the Jamesian context, this "Kingdom" is a present ethical reality manifested in the community of the poor 2\.*  
* **ὑπαρχόντων (hyparchontōn):** *Literally "things belonging to them." This highlights the economic substrate of the early movement, where the wealthy were commanded to redistribute their material possessions to support the mission to the Poor 2\.*

**8:16** Οὐδεὶς δὲ λύχνον ἅψας καλύπτει αὐτὸν σκεύει ἢ ὑποκάτω κλίνης τίθησιν, ἀλλ᾽ ἐπὶ λυχνίας τίθησιν, ἵνα οἱ εἰσπορευόμενοι βλέπωσιν τὸ φῶς. **17** οὐ γάρ ἐστιν κρυπτὸν ὃ οὐ φανερὸν γενήσεται, οὐδὲ ἀπόκρυφον ὃ οὐ μὴ γνωσθῇ. **18** βλέπετε οὖν πῶς ἀκούετε· ὃς ἂν γὰρ ἔχῃ, δοθήσεται αὐτῷ, καὶ ὃς ἂν μὴ ἔχῃ, καὶ ὃ **δοκεῖ ἔχειν** ἀρθήσεται ἀπ᾽ αὐτοῦ.

* *Notes on Greek Text and Reconstruction:*  
* **δοκεῖ ἔχειν (dokei echein):** *“What he thinks he has.” This is a dry forensic warning against an intellectual or "spiritualized" faith that lacks the weight of actual work. The practitioner is stripped of the perceived grace because it never manifested in concrete reality of Love 3\.*  
* **κρυπτόν (krypton):** *The Protograph prioritizes the manifestation of truth in the physical realm. The "Light" is not a private Gnostic secret but the public manifestation of Love 3\.*  
* **Omission in 8:17:** *The reconstruction follows the more primitive stratum which omits "and come to light." This focuses on the clinical state of the hidden becoming known through the Spirit’s presence.*

**8:20** Ἀπηγγέλη δὲ αὐτῷ· Ἡ μήτηρ σου καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοί σου ἑστήκασιν ἔξω ἰδεῖν θέλοντές σε. **21** ὁ δὲ ἀποκριθεὶς εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτούς· **Τίς μου ἡ μήτηρ καὶ τίνες οἱ ἀδελφοί μου;** εἰ μὴ οἱ τὸν λόγον τοῦ θεοῦ ἀκούοντες καὶ **ποιοῦντες**.

* *Notes on Greek Text and Reconstruction:*  
* **Excision of 8:19:** *The arrival of the biological family is omitted in this stratum to sharpen the polemical impact of the Savior's definition of his true kin 4\.*  
* **Τίς μου ἡ μήτηρ...; (Tis mou hē mētēr...):** *The reconstruction follows the interrogative variant preserved by Tertullian and Marcion. It serves to decouple the Messenger from biological and biological-Davidic authority, prioritizing pneumatic loyalty 4\.*  
* **ποιοῦντες (poiountes):** *“Doing.” This present participle is the definitive Jamesian marker. The community is not defined by biological descent, but by the active "Doing" of the internal Law of Love 4\.*
