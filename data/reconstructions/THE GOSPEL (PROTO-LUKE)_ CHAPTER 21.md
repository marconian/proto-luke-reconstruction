### THE GOSPEL (PROTO-LUKE): CHAPTER 21

**23:1** And the whole multitude of them arose and led him to **Pilate** 1\. **2** And they began to accuse him, saying: "We found this man perverting our nation, and **destroying the law and the prophets**, and forbidding to give tribute to **Caesar**, saying that he himself is **the Christ**, a king" 1, 2\. **3** And **Pilate** questioned him, saying: "Are you **the Christ**?" And he answering him said: "You say it" 1, 3\.

* *Notes on the Accusation and Title:*  
* **Destroying the law and the prophets (καταλύοντα τὸν νόμον καὶ τοὺς προφήτας):** *This specific charge is explicitly attested by Epiphanius as a diagnostic marker of this stratum 1, 2, 4\. It confirms the clinical nature of the Messenger’s mission: the total abrogation of the old legal and prophetic debris rather than a mere internal reform.*  
* **The Christ (ὁ Χριστός):** *The reconstruction follows the variant where the title "The Christ" is prioritized over the Roman political category "King of the Jews," centering the trial on the pneumatic function of the Messenger 1\.*

**23:7** And when Pilate learned that he was of **Herod's jurisdiction**, he **sent him to Herod**, who was himself in Jerusalem in those days 5, 6\. **8** And **Herod, seeing Jesus, was very glad**, for he had for a long time desired to see him, because he had heard concerning him; and he was hoping to see some sign done by him 5-7. **9** And he questioned him with many words, but **he answered him nothing** 5, 6\. **11** And **Herod with his soldiers**, having **treated him with contempt** and mocked him, having thrown a **shining robe** around him, sent him back to Pilate 5-7.

* *Notes on the Herod Pericope:*  
* **Herod (Ἡρῴδην):** *The inclusion of this sequence is confirmed by both Tertullian and Epiphanius, reflecting the consensus of the world’s local and imperial authorities in rejecting the Messenger 5-7.*  
* **Treated him with contempt (ἐξουθενήσας — exouthenēsas):** *A dry forensic term for the nullification of Jesus’s status as a biological or political threat 5, 7\.*  
* **Shining robe (ἐσθῆτα λαμπρὰν):** *The "shining" or "bright" robe is used clinically to mock the pneumatic claim of divine radiance, casting it as a farce within the material world 5, 7\.*

**23:18** And they cried out all at once, saying: "Away with this man, and release to us **Barabbas**\!" 6, 8\. **19** (Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.) 6, 8\. **21** But they cried out, saying: "Crucify, crucify him\!" 6, 8\. **25** And he released to them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison... but he delivered **Jesus** to their will 6, 8\.

* *Notes on Barabbas:*  
* **Murder (φόνον):** *The exchange of the "Just One" for a "murderer" is a forensic demonstration of the inverted values of the current age 6, 8\.*

**23:32** And there were also two others, **criminals**, led with him to be put to death 9, 10\. **33** And when they were come to the place, which is called **Skull**, there they crucified him, and the **criminals**, one on the right hand, and the other on the left 9, 10\.  
**23:34b** The narrative of the soldiers **dividing his garments and casting lots** is **Not Present** in this stratum 9\.

* *Notes on Textual Excision:*  
* **Criminals (κακούργοι):** *The use of this term maintains a focus on the clinical reality of the execution 9\.*  
* **Omission of the Lots:** *Tertullian explicitly identifies the "casting of lots" (23:34b) as an interpolation intended to force a fulfillment of Psalm 22:18 9, 11\. By removing this, the text stays honest to the event as a standard state execution 9\.*

**23:39** And one of the **criminals** who were hanged railed on him, saying: "If you are **the Christ**, save yourself and us\!" 9, 12\. **40** But the other answering rebuked him, saying: "Do you not fear God, seeing you are in the same condemnation?" 9, 12\. **42** And he said to **Jesus**: "Lord, remember me when you come into your kingdom" 9, 13\. **43** And **Jesus** said to him: "Verily I say to you, **today** you shall be with me in **Paradise**" 9, 13, 14\.

* *Notes on the Penitent Criminal:*  
* **Today... in Paradise (σήμερον... ἐν τῷ παραδείσῳ):** *While Epiphanius indicates that some versions excised this verse to deny the immediate transition 12, 15, Tertullian preserves it 13, 16\. It represents the core "Jamesian" theme of immediate pneumatic transition rather than a delayed material resuscitation 14, 17\.*

**23:44** And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a **darkness** over all the earth until the ninth hour 18, 19\. **45** And the sun was darkened, and the **veil of the temple** was rent in the midst 18, 19\. **46** And when **Jesus** had cried with a loud voice, he said: "**Father, into your hands I commend my spirit**"; and having said thus, he **expired** 14, 18, 19\.

* *Notes on the Final Act:*  
* **Commend (παρατίθεμαι):** *A forensic deposit. The spirit is clinically returned to its source as the material vessel is exhausted 18\.*  
* **Relationship to the Father:** *The prayer "Father, into your hands..." (23:46) contrasts with the Markan cry of abandonment, depicting the Messenger as one whose spiritual sight remains open even during physical destruction 18, 20\.*

**23:50** And, behold, there was a man named **Joseph**, a counselor... 18, 19\. **51** (The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them)... 18, 19\. **52** This man went to **Pilate**, and begged the body of **Jesus** 18, 19\. **53** And he took it down, and wrapped it in **linen**, and laid it in a **sepulchre that was hewn in stone**, where never man before was laid 18, 19\.

* *Notes on the Burial:*  
* **Hewn in stone (λαξευτῷ):** *The emphasis on the stone tomb provides the forensic baseline for the subsequent spiritual manifestations; the physical body remains interred according to Second Temple custom 18, 21\.*
