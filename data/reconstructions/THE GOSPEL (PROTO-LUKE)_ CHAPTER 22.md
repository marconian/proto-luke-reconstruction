There is indeed a final chapter. The following is the forensic reconstruction of the **twenty-second chapter** of the **Jamesian Protograph** (Proto-Luke), which corresponds to the twenty-fourth chapter of the canonical text.  
This concluding chapter is the most heavily redacted in the traditional Bible. To recover the original Jamesian layer, we must apply the "Excision Protocol" to remove the second-century "Anti-Docetic" additions. This reveals a narrative not of a resuscitated corpse, but of a profound **spiritual manifestation** (*Soma Pneumatikon*) that aligns with the earliest traditions of the Jerusalem Church 1, 2\.

### THE GOSPEL (PROTO-LUKE): CHAPTER 22

**24:1** On the first of the Sabbaths, at deep dawn, they came to the tomb bringing the spices they had prepared. **2** They found the stone rolled away from the tomb. **3** Entering, they did not find the body. **4** It happened while they were perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in **flashing clothes**. **5** As they were afraid and bowed their faces to the ground, they said to them, "Why do you seek the living with the dead? **6** He is not here, but has been **raised**. Remember how he spoke to you while still in Galilee, **7** saying that it is necessary for the **son of man** to be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and on the third day to rise." **8** And they remembered his words. **9** Returning from the tomb, they reported all these things to the eleven and to all the rest. **11** These words seemed to them as nonsense, and they did not believe them.

* *Notes on the Tomb Manifestation:*  
* **Raised** (*ἠγέρθη \- ēgerthē*): *I have translated this as a passive verb to stay true to the Greek, which denotes an act of God upon the man, rather than a self-directed "rising" 3, 4\.*  
* **Flashing clothes** (*ἀστραπτούσῃ \- astraptousē*): *A dry, clinical description. The radiance mirrors the sensory overload described in prophetic visions, marking this as a spiritual rather than mundane event 3, 4\.*  
* **Omission of v. 12:** *The account of Peter running to the tomb is a "Western Non-Interpolation," absent in the Marcionite and early Western strata. It was added later to harmonize Luke with the Gospel of John 5, 6\.*

**24:13** Behold, two of them on that same day were going to a village called Emmaus. **15** While they were talking and debating, Jesus himself drew near and went with them. **16** But their eyes were held so they did not recognize him. **30** It happened that when he reclined with them, taking the bread, he blessed and, breaking it, he gave it to them. **31** Their eyes were opened, and they recognized him; and he became **invisible** to them. **32** They said to one another, "Was not our heart burning while he spoke to us on the road?" **33** Rising in that same hour, they returned to Jerusalem and found the eleven gathered, **35** and they explained the things on the road and how he was known to them in the **breaking of the bread**.

* *Notes on the Road Manifestation:*  
* **Invisible** (*ἄφαντος \- aphantos*): *Literally "not appearing" or "vanishing." This confirms a pneumatic body not constrained by material laws 7, 8\.*  
* **Breaking of the bread:** *In the Jamesian stratum, the recognition is triggered by a ritual act and an internal affective state ("hearts burning") rather than a physical inspection 9\.*

**24:36** While they were saying these things, he himself stood in the midst of them and said, "Peace to you." **37** Being terrified and afraid, they thought they were seeing a **spirit**. **38** He said to them, "Why are you troubled, and why do debates arise in your hearts? **44** These are my words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that it is necessary for all things written in the law of Moses and the prophets and psalms about me to be fulfilled." **45** Then he opened their **mind** to understand the scriptures. **47** ...and that repentance into **forgiveness** of sins should be proclaimed in his name to all the nations. **48** You are witnesses of these things. **51** It happened while he was blessing them, he **parted** from them. **52** They returned to Jerusalem with great joy, **53** and they were continually in the **Temple** praising and blessing God.

* *Notes on the Final Manifestation and Separation:*  
* **Spirit** (*πνεῦμα \- pneuma*): *The text records that the default perception of the core witnesses was that of a non-corporeal entity 10, 11\.*  
* **Omission of vv. 39–43:** *Crucial forensic excision. The claims of "flesh and bones" and the act of eating fish are 2nd-century anti-Docetic interpolations. They were added to "lock down" a physicalist theology that explicitly contradicts the earlier Jamesian/Pauline teaching that "flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom" (1 Cor 15:50) 1, 2, 6\.*  
* **Mind** (*νοῦν \- noun*): *The enlightenment is intellectual and spiritual, moving the disciples from historical debris to pneumatic understanding 2, 12\.*  
* **Parted** (*διέστη \- diestē*): *The "Western Short Form" lacks the physical levitation/ascension into the clouds found in v. 51b. The original text records a simple cessation of the spiritual manifestation 8, 13\.*  
* **Temple** (*ἱερῷ \- hierō*): *The Protograph ends where it began: in the Temple. This emphasizes the community's role as the "Opposition Priesthood" in the holy city 8, 14\.*

### Summary of the Jamesian Protograph

The reconstruction of this final chapter completes the **Jamesian Protograph**. By removing the later orthodox "plaster"—the birth narratives, the physicalist resurrection proofs, and the post-70 CE revisions—we recover the "Gospel of the Poor" 15, 16\.

1. **Resurrection as Exaltation:** The original text concludes not with a medical resuscitation, but with a spiritual enthronement. Jesus remains "alive" as a living presence and a source of grace, while his bones remained interred in the family tomb in accordance with Judean custom 1, 17, 18\.  
2. **The Authority of the Word:** The climax is not a physical touch, but the opening of the **Mind** to the Word. The authority of the movement is grounded in the Spirit-empowered understanding of the Law and the Prophets 2, 19\.  
3. **The Jerusalem Center:** The final image of the disciples in the **Temple** confirms that the movement remained a Jewish-Christian institution centered in Jerusalem, prior to the later Pauline shift toward a Gentile-only mission 8, 14\.
