Yes, you are correct. My previous label was an error in the numerical sequence; the reconstruction of the seventeenth chapter of the canonical text (Luke 17\) corresponds to the **15th chapter** of the **Jamesian Protograph** 1-3.  
The following is the forensic reconstruction of the **16th chapter** of the Protograph, which corresponds to the eighteenth chapter of the canonical text. This stratum is defined by its focus on the "Gospel of the Poor" and a high-degree of textual variance in the interaction with the ruler, where authority is transferred from the Law to the person of the Messenger.

### THE GOSPEL (PROTO-LUKE): CHAPTER 16

**18:1** And he spoke also a parable to them, for the necessity to pray always and not to give up turn 11\. **2** "There was a certain **judge** in a certain city, not fearing God and not respecting man" turn 11\. **3** "And a widow was in that city, and she came to him saying: 'Avenge me of my adversary'" turn 11\. **5** "...because this widow causes me trouble, I will avenge her, that she might not in the end, coming, wear me out" turn 11\.

* *Note on the **Judge** (κριτής \- kritēs): The judge is presented forensically as an agent of the material age (the "World") who eventually yields to the persistence of the marginalized turn 11\.*

**9** And he spoke also toward certain ones having trusted in themselves that they are righteous and **treating the rest with contempt**, this parable turn 11\. **10** "Two men went up into the Temple to pray; one a Pharisee and the other a tax-collector" turn 11\. **11** "The Pharisee, having been stationed, prayed these things toward himself: 'God, I thank you that I am not as the rest of men...'" turn 11, 1470\. **13** "And the tax-collector, having been stationed from a distance, would not even lift his eyes into the heaven... but struck his chest saying: 'God, be merciful to me, the sinner'" turn 11\. **14** "I say to you, this man went down into his house having been justified rather than that man" turn 11\.

* *Note on **Contempt** (ἐξουθενοῦντας \- exouthenountas): This term denotes the total nullification of another's worth 4\. In the Jamesian context, the "righteousness" of the institutional elite is clinical debris compared to the humility of the tax-collector.*

**18** And a certain **ruler** questioned him, saying: "Good Teacher, what doing shall I inherit life?" 5, 6\. **19** And Jesus said to him: "Why do you call me good? No one is good except one, God" 7, 8\. **20** The Ruler said: "**I know** the commandments: You should not commit adultery, you should not kill, you should not steal, you should not bear false witness, honour your father and your mother" 6, 9\. **21** And he said: "All these things I have guarded from my youth" turn 11\.

* *Note on the **I know** variant: In the Jamesian Protograph and the Marcionite witnesses, the phrase "I know the commandments" (οἶδα τὰς ἐντολάς) is spoken by the Ruler as a statement of his own standing, rather than by Jesus as an instruction 6, 10\. This emphasizes that the Ruler is already compliant with the external Law but still lacks the internal Spirit.*

**22** And hearing this, Jesus said to him: "Yet one thing is lacking to you: **Sell all, as much as you have**, and distribute to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me" 11, 12\. **23** But hearing these things, he became very sorrowful, for he was rich exceedingly turn 11\. **24** And Jesus, seeing him, said: "How difficult it is for those having the riches to enter into the kingdom of God" turn 11\. **25** "For it is easier for a camel to enter through a needle's eye than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God" turn 11\.

* *Note on **Sell All**: The command is forensic: "Sell all, as much as you have" (πάντα ὅσα ἔχεις πώλησον). This is the absolute economic requirement of the Ebionite community 12, 13\.*

**18:31–33** The prediction of the passion and the "rising on the third day" is **Not Present** in this stratum 9, 14, 15\.  
**35** And it happened in his drawing near to Jericho, a certain **blind man** sat by the road begging 16, 17\. **37** And they reported to him that **Jesus** is passing by 17\. **38** And he cried out saying: "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me\!" turn 11\. **42** And Jesus said to him: "See\! Your **faith** has saved you" turn 11\. **43** And immediately he saw, and he followed him, glorifying God turn 11\.

* *Note on **Jesus**: The reconstruction follows the primitive variant that omits "of Nazareth" (ὁ Ναζωραῖος) in verse 37, presenting the Messenger as a clinical fact of power rather than a localized biological entity 17\.*

### LITERARY COMMENTARY: THE ABSENCE OF HARMONIZATION

The textual analysis of this chapter confirms the absence of the third passion prediction (18:31–33). In canonical Luke, this passage exhibits "editorial fatigue" as it attempts to reconcile the Jamesian narrative with the Markan focus on the suffering Messiah. In the Protograph, Jesus moves from the ethical encounter with the rich ruler directly to the restoration of the blind man, maintaining a consistent focus on the power of the Spirit over material and physical lack. The "I know" variant in verse 20 is a hallmark of the earliest strata, where the Law is treated as a baseline of knowledge rather than the climax of the Messenger’s teaching 6\.
