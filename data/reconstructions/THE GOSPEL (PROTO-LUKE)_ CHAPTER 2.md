The following is the forensic reconstruction of the second phase of the **Jamesian Protograph** (Proto-Luke), focusing on the established authority of the Divine Human in Galilee and the calling of the first disciples to the "Works of Love."  
Following the rejection at Nazareth, the narrative shifts to the clinical manifestations of the Spirit’s power in Capernaum and the subsequent formation of the core community.

### Proto-Luke Chapter 2

**4:34** "What is to us and to you, Jesus? Have you come to destroy us? I know you, who you are—the holy one of God." **35** And Jesus rebuked him. **40** And when the sun was setting, all who had any sick with various diseases brought them to him; and he laid hands on each of them and healed them. **41** And messengers spirits also were coming out from many, crying out and saying: "You are the son of God." And rebuking them, he did not allow them to speak. **43** And he said to them: "I must also announce the kingdom of God to the other cities, because for this I was sent."  
**5:1** And it happened, while the crowd pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret. **2** And he saw two boats standing by the lake; but the fishermen had gone out of them and were washing their nets. **3** And entering into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, he asked him to put out a little from the land. And sitting down, he was teaching the crowds from the boat. **4** And when he ceased speaking, he said to Simon: "Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch." **5** And Simon answering said: "Master, through the whole night we toiled and took nothing; but at your word I will let down the net." **6** And having done this, they enclosed a great multitude of fishes; and their nets were breaking. **8** But Simon Peter, seeing it, fell down at the knees of Jesus, saying: "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, Lord." **10** And Jesus said to Simon: "Fear not; from now on you shall be catching men." **11** And having brought the boats to the land, they left all and followed him.  
**12** And it happened, while he was in one of the cities, behold, a man full of leprosy. And seeing Jesus, he fell on his face and begged him, saying: "Lord, if you will, you are able to cleanse me." **13** And stretching out his hand, he touched him, saying: "I will; be cleansed." And immediately the leprosy departed from him. **14** And he commanded him to tell no one: "But go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing according as Moses commanded, for a testimony to them."  
*Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*

* **What is to us and to you (τί ἡμῖν καὶ σοί \- ti hēmin kai soi):**  
* *This is a literal translation of a Hebraic idiom denoting a disconnect in purpose or authority 1\.*  
* *The term "Nazarene" is excluded here, as it is absent in the earliest Marcionite/Jamesian witnesses, likely to decouple the Savior from a specific geographical/biological origin 1, 2\.*  
* **Messengers (δαιμόνια \- daimonia):**  
* *Per the translation philosophy, I have avoided the loaded term "demons" in favor of "messengers" or "spirits" to reflect their function as entities testifying to the Savior's identity 3, 4\.*  
* **Kingdom of God (τὴν βασιλείαν τοῦ θεοῦ \- tēn basileian tou theou):**  
* *This phrase is a hallmark of the Lukan/Proto-Lukan layer. It identifies the "Actual Jesus" not as a personal savior, but as the herald of a new spiritual order 5, 6\.*  
* **Catching Men (ἀνθρώπους ἔσῃ ζωγρῶν \- anthrōpous esē zōgrōn):**  
* *The specific Lukan vocation narrative (5:1-11) is retained as a Jamesian original. Unlike the abrupt Markan calling, this emphasizes a "miraculous catch," establishing the dependence of the disciples on divine power rather than their own merit 7, 8\.*  
* **Moses Commanded (καθὼς προσέταξε Μωυσῆς \- kathōs prosetaxe Mōysēs):**  
* *The preservation of this reference (5:14) is critical. It shows the Jamesian Jesus upholding the Law as a "testimony," prioritizing the internal reality of cleansing while maintaining external continuity with the Torah 9, 10\.*

### Additional Explanation: The Mechanics of Authority

The transition from the Incipit to the calling of the disciples represents the "Historical Bricolage" stage of the movement 11\. In this second chapter, we see the primary mission defined as a "direct spiritual battle against the forces of disorder" 12\.

1. **The Rejection of Bio-History:** By initiating the narrative with the Capernaum healings (4:31) and moving the Nazareth rejection to a secondary position, the Jamesian Protograph establishes Jesus's authority through **deeds of power** rather than **Davidic genealogy** 13\.  
2. **The Fisher of the Poor:** The choice of Simon, a manual laborer (Ebionite/Poor), identifies the movement's target demographic. The "multitude of fishes" serves as a physical manifestation of the boundless nature of divine providence, intended for a community struggling after the physical destruction of the Temple 8, 14\.  
3. **The Forensic Healing:** The cleansing of the leper (5:12-14) is a paradigmatic example of Jesus in his embodied ministry 15\. Jesus does not merely speak; he **touches** the leper. This physical contact—forbidden by ritual law—shatters the corrupt external forms to restore the inner person 6\.

This chapter solidifies the Jamesian view that the Kingdom is entered not through a confession of faith in a "Cosmic Christ," but through active participation in the restoration of humanity through "Works of Love."
