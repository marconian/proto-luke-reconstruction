The following is the forensic reconstruction of the **eighteenth chapter** of the **Jamesian Protograph** (Proto-Luke), which corresponds to the twentieth chapter of the canonical text. This stratum continues the confrontation with the Jerusalem elite, focusing on the source of authority and the rejection of material/biological ties in the age to come.  
Crucially, the "Parable of the Wicked Tenants" (20:9–18) and the "Proof from the Bush" (20:37–38a) are **Not Present** in this primitive layer, as they serve later canonical interests in establishing a biological inheritance from the prophets and a patriarchal theological framework.

### THE GOSPEL (PROTO-LUKE): CHAPTER 18

**20:1** "And it happened on one of the days, as he was teaching the people in the **Temple** and announcing the good news..." 1, 2\.  
*Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*

* **Temple (ἱερῷ \- hierō):** *The term refers specifically to the physical complex where the Jamesian "Opposition Priesthood" confronted the Sadducean establishment 1, 3\.*  
* **Announcing the good news (εὐαγγελίζομαι \- euangelizomai):** *The reconstruction prioritizes this verb as a Lukan redactional marker found in the Protograph, denoting a formal royal proclamation 2\.*

**20:4** "The baptism of John, was it from heaven or from men?" **5** And they reasoned among themselves, saying: "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Why did you not believe him?'" **6** "But if we say, 'From men,' all the people will stone us..." 1, 4\.  
**20:8** "And he said to them, 'Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things'" 1\.  
**20:9–18** The Parable of the Wicked Tenants is **Not Present** in this stratum 1, 5\.  
*Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*

* **Omission of the Tenants:** *Epiphanius confirms this section was absent 5\. The parable anchors Jesus in a biological "inheritance" (klēronomia) from the previous "prophets," a concept the Protograph rejects in favor of a pneumatic descent 6, 7\.*

**20:19** "And the scribes and the chief priests sought to lay hands on him in that very hour, and they feared the people" 1, 8\.  
**20:20–23** These verses, involving the spies and the entrapment, are **Unattested** in the primitive stratum 1\.  
**20:24** "Show me a **denarius**. Whose image and inscription does it have?" And they said, "**Caesar's**" 1\.  
*Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*

* **Denarius (δηνάριον):** *A dry forensic fact—the Roman silver coin representing the "Mammon of unrighteousness" within the imperial economy 1\.*

**20:25** "And he said to them: 'Give back therefore the things of **Caesar** to **Caesar**, and the things of God to God'" 1\.  
*Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*

* **Give back (ἀπόδοτε \- apodote):** *I have used "give back" to reflect the Greek sense of rendering a debt or returning what is already owed to the worldly power, separating it entirely from the things of the Spirit 1\.*

**20:27–34** These verses are **Unattested** as a continuous narrative in this layer 1\.  
**20:35** "But those considered worthy to attain that age and the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage" 9, 10\.  
*Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*

* **Attain (τυχεῖν):** *The reconstruction confirms that entry into the "age to come" is a pneumatic achievement rather than a biological right 11\.*  
* **Neither marry nor are given in marriage:** *This highlights the Jamesian/Ebionite focus on asceticism and the dissolution of self-centered attachments through the abolition of biological family structures 9, 12\.*

**20:36** The verse concerning "equal to messengers" is **Unattested** in this stratum 1\.  
**20:37–38a** The passage concerning Moses and the Bush is **Not Present** in this stratum 1, 13\.  
*Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*

* **Omission of the Bush:** *Epiphanius explicitly states that this section was absent 13\. Its removal excises the canonical attempt to anchor the resurrection in the "God of the Fathers" (Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob), maintaining the Protograph's focus on the Spirit over historical biology 13, 14\.*

**20:41** "And he said to them: 'How do they say that the **Christ** is the son of David?'" **44** "David therefore calls him 'Lord,' and how is he his son?" 15, 16\.  
*Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*

* **Christ (Χριστός):** *The use of the title here serves a disambiguating function, distancing the pneumatic Christ from the biological/Davidic lineage expected by the Judean elite 16, 17\.*

**20:45–47** The warning against the scribes is **Unattested** in the primitive stratum 1\.
