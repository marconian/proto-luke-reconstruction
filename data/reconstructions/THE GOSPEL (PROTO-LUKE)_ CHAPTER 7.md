The following is the forensic reconstruction of the seventh chapter of the **Jamesian Protograph** (Proto-Luke). This section encompasses the culmination of the Galilean ministry, the revelation of the "Spiritual Body" on the mountain, and the beginning of the "Travel Narrative."  
In this stratum, the narrative focuses on the internal authority of the Messenger, the cost of discipleship within the "Opposition Priesthood," and the rejection of biological and material claims in favor of the "Kingdom of God."

### THE GOSPEL (PROTO-LUKE): CHAPTER 7

**9:18** And it happened while he was praying alone, the disciples were with him, and he asked them saying: "Who do the crowds say I am?" **19** And they answering said: "John the Baptist, but others Elijah, and others that a prophet, one of the ancients, has risen." **20** And he said to them: "But you, who do you say I am?" and Peter answering said: "The Christ of God." 1-3  
**21** But he, having strictly charged them, commanded them to tell this to no one, **22** saying: "It is necessary for the **son of man** to suffer many things and to be rejected by the elders and the high priests and the scribes, and to be killed, and on the third day to be raised." 4, 5  
**24** "For whoever wants to save his life shall lose it; but whoever loses his life for my sake, he shall save it." **26** "For whoever is ashamed of me and my words, of him the **son of man** shall be ashamed when he comes in his glory." 4, 6, 7  
**28** And it happened after these words, about eight days, taking Peter and John and James, he went up into the mountain to pray. **29** And it happened while he was praying, the appearance of his face was different and his clothing was white and flashing. **30** And behold, two men were talking with him, who were Moses and Elijah. **35** And a voice came out of the cloud saying: "This is my son, the **beloved**; listen to him." 8-14  
**44** "Place these words in your ears; for the **son of man** is about to be delivered into the hands of men." 8, 15  
**47** And Jesus, seeing the reasoning of their heart, took a child and set him by himself, **48** and said to them: "Whoever receives this child in my name receives me; and whoever receives me receives him who sent me." 8, 16  
**57** And as they were going in the road, someone said to him: "I will follow you wherever you go." **58** And Jesus said to him: "The foxes have holes and the birds of the heaven nests, but the **son of man** has not where he may lay his head." **59** And he said to another: "Follow me." But he said: "Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father." **60** But he said to him: "Leave the dead to bury their own dead, but you go and **announce** the kingdom of God." **61** And another also said: "I will follow you, Lord, but first permit me to say goodbye to those in my house." **62** But Jesus said to him: "No one having put his hand to the plow and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God." 8, 17  
*Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*

* **Son of Man (ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ ἀνθρώπου \- ho huios tou anthrōpou):**  
* *The Greek refers to the "Son of the Human." In this stratum, it denotes the representative of the restored humanity, often used by Jesus to refer to himself as the eschatological judge 18, 19\.*  
* **Beloved (ἀγαπητός \- agapētos):**  
* *Marcion’s text and the early Jamesian witnesses prioritize "Beloved" over the canonical "Chosen" (ἐκλελεγμένος). "Beloved" emphasizes the internal conjunction of Love between the Father and the Messenger 13\.*  
* **Announce (διάγγελλε \- diangelle):**  
* *Translation choice: "Announce" is used to capture the sense of a herald's distinct duty. In v. 60, this is the command given to the "Slave" of the Kingdom, which overrides even the duty to the biological father 8\.*  
* **The Seam of the "Great Omission":**  
* *In this reconstruction, the narrative flows directly from the feeding of the 5000 (9:17) to Peter's Confession (9:18). This bypasses the large block of Markan material (Mk 6:45–8:26) which includes Jesus walking on water. The sources identify this as a "non-interpolation"—the Markan material was never part of the original Jamesian Protograph 3\.*  
* **Moses and Elijah (9:30):**  
* *The presence of the "Law and the Prophets" on the mountain serves as a forensic testimony to Jesus's authority. Jamesian theology viewed Jesus as the internal fulfillment of the Law, making the presence of Moses a validation of the "Royal Law" of Love 19, 20\.*  
* **Rejection of the Dead (9:60):**  
* *The command to "Leave the dead to bury their own dead" is a hallmark of the Ebionite/Jamesian focus on the "Living Word" over the "debris" of biological tradition and family preservation 21\.*

### Additional Explanation: The Ascension of the Spirit

Chapter 7 of the Jamesian Protograph marks the "Transfiguration"—the phenomenological manifestation of the **Jesus**.

1. **The Spiritual Body:** The description of Jesus's face and clothing (9:29) reflects a visionary, pneumatic experience rather than a material change. This aligns with the "Spiritual Resurrection" theology of the Jerusalem pillars, where the physical body is a shell for the glorified "Being of Light" 22, 23\.  
2. **The Rejection of Bio-Dynasty:** In the "following" narratives (9:57-62), Jesus demands total renunciation of property (nests/holes) and biological family (burying the father). This is the "Epistemology of Doing," where loyalty to the community of the Poor (*Ebionim*) is the only valid marker of identity 21, 24\.  
3. **The Authority of the Word:** By rebuking Peter’s biological confession and substituting it with the Passion prediction (9:21-22), Jesus establishes that the Messenger is defined by his **Suffering Use** (service) and not his earthly status. This is the core of the Jamesian critique of the Pauline "Cosmic Christ"—true authority is found in the grit of ethical action on the way to Jerusalem.
