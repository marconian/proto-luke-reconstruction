The following is the forensic reconstruction of the fourteenth chapter of **The Gospel** (Proto-Luke), which corresponds to the sixteenth chapter of the canonical text. This stratum is arguably the most critical for understanding the "Jamesian" identity of the early movement, containing the radical socio-economic instructions for the *Ebionim* (The Poor) and the definitive Lazarus narrative 1, 2\.  
Consistent with the lack of "editorial fatigue" in the Marcionite witnesses, these readings are presented as the primitive source rather than a redaction of the later canonical text 3\.

### THE GOSPEL (PROTO-LUKE): CHAPTER 14

**16:1–8** \[The Parable of the Unjust Steward is **Unattested** as a narrative in this stratum, though its themes of stewardship inform the following verses 4.\]  
**9** "And I say to you, make for yourselves friends from the **mammon of unrighteousness**, that when it fails, they may receive you into the eternal dwellings" 5, 6\. **11** "If then you were not faithful in the **unrighteous mammon**, who will entrust to you the true?" 6\. **12** "And if you were not found faithful in that which belongs to another, who will give to you that which is **mine**?" 6, 7\.

* *Note on the Mammon of Unrighteousness (μαμωνᾶ τῆς ἀδικίας \- mamōna tēs adikias): "Unrighteousness" is the dry forensic rendering of adikia, denoting wealth accumulated within the corrupt legal and economic framework of the current age 8\.*  
* *Note on "Mine" (τὸ ἐμὸν \- to emon): While canonical texts read "your own" (τὸ ὑμέτερον), the Jamesian Protograph emphasizes that spiritual wealth is the specific property of the Messenger, which he chooses to share with the faithful 7\.*

**13** "No **slave** is able to serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will hold to one and despise the other. You are not able to serve God and mammon" 6, 9\.

* *Note on Slave (οἰκέτης \- oiketēs): Per the translation protocol, "slave" is used to reflect the total, singular loyalty required by the household economy of the Kingdom 9\.*

**16** "The law and the prophets were **until** John; since then the kingdom of God is **announced**, and everyone is forced into it" 8, 10\. **17** "It is easier for heaven and earth to pass than for one tittle of **my words** to pass" 10, 11\.

* *Note on "Until" (μέχρι \- mechri): This designates a historical boundary, suggesting that the era of the Law and Prophets reached its terminus with John 12\.*  
* *Note on "Announced" (εὐαγγελίζεται \- euangelizetai): I have avoided "preached" to maintain the forensic sense of a royal herald making a formal proclamation 13\.*  
* *Note on "My Words" (τῶν λόγων μου \- tōn logōn mou): Multiple sources indicate that in this stratum, the permanence of Jesus's own proclamation replaces the permanence of the Mosaic Law 11\.*

**18** "Every one who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery; and he who marries a woman divorced from a husband likewise commits adultery" 10, 14\.  
**19** "There was a certain rich man, and he dressed in purple and fine linen, enjoying himself daily in splendor" 10, 15\. **20** "And there was a certain poor man named **Lazarus**, who had been cast at his gate, full of sores" 10, 15\. **21** "...and desiring to be fed from the things falling from the table of the rich man..." 16\.  
**22** "And it happened that the poor man died and was carried by the **messengers** into Abraham's bosom; and the rich man also died and was buried" 17\. **23** "And in **Hades**, lifting up his eyes, being in torments, he sees Abraham from a distance and Lazarus in his bosom" 10, 18\.

* *Note on Lazarus (Λάζαρος \- Lazaros): The only named character in the parables, likely an etymological signifier for the Ebionite (Poor) sect 2\.*  
* *Note on Hades (ᾅδῃ \- hadē): Retained as the topographical term for the unseen realm of the dead, rather than the theological "Hell" 18\.*

**24** "And he cried out and said, 'Father Abraham, have mercy on me and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am in anguish in this flame'" 19\.  
**25** "But Abraham said, 'Child, remember that you received your good things in your life... but now he is comforted **here**, and you are in anguish'" 20\. **26** "And besides all these things, between us and you a **great chasm** has been fixed..." 21\.

* *Note on "Here" (ὧδε \- hōde): Found in the "Western" witnesses and the Jamesian stratum, emphasizing the immediate spatial reality of the spiritual state 21\.*

**27** "And he said, 'I ask you then, father, that you send him to my father’s house, **28** for I have five brothers...'" 22\. **29** "But Abraham says to him, 'They have Moses and the prophets; let them listen to them'" 23, 24\. **30** "But he said, 'No, father Abraham, but if someone from the dead should go to them, they will repent'" 25\. **31** "And he said to him, 'If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets, neither will they be convinced if someone from the dead should rise'" 25\.

* *Note on v. 31: This verse serves as a stunning affirmation of the sufficiency of the Hebrew scriptures (the Law and Prophets) for ethical guidance, even over the physical sign of a resurrection 2\.*

### LITERARY COMMENTARY: THE EBIONITE MANIFESTO

Chapter 14 of the Protograph defines the movement's relationship to wealth and lineage.

1. **The Abolition of Private Mammon:** The instructions in verses 9–13 constitute an economic "Path of Reversal." Wealth is clinical debris; the only valid "use" for it is to liquidate it for the benefit of the community to secure "eternal dwellings" 1, 26\.  
2. **Biological vs. Pneumatic Property:** By contrasting "another's" (material) wealth with "mine" (Jesus's spiritual words), the text creates a dualism where only the pneumatic influx is true property 7, 27\.  
3. **The Sufficiency of the Word:** The Lazarus narrative (16:19-31) functions as a polemic against those who demand signs (like physical resurrection appearances). Abraham’s refusal to send Lazarus back establishes that the "Royal Law of Love" found in the Prophets is the ultimate authority, surpassing even the resuscitation of a corpse 2, 28\.
