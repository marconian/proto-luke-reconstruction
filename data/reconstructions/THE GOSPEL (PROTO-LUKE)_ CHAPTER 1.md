The following text is a forensic reconstruction of the opening of the **Jamesian Protograph**, commonly identified as **Proto-Luke** or the **Marcionite Evangelion**. This reconstruction necessitates the total excision of the canonical chapters 1 and 2, which are recognized as later "Pastoral" additions designed to anchor the narrative in Davidic biology and Temple piety 1-4.  
In this Jamesian core, the narrative begins not with a birth, but with a sudden descent of the Spirit into the historical timeframe of the Roman Empire 5-8.

### Proto-Luke Chapter 1

**1** In the fifteenth year of the governance of Tiberius Caesar, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod was tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip was tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene, 3, 9 **2** he came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and was teaching them on the Sabbaths; 3, 7 **3** and they were astonished at his teaching, because his word was with authority. 3, 10, 11 **4** And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up; and as was his custom, he entered the assembly on the Sabbath day and stood up to read. 10, 12, 13 **5** And all were bearing witness to him and were wondering at the words of grace proceeding out of his mouth. 10, 14 **6** And he said to them, "Doubtless you will say to me this proverb: 'Healer, heal yourself'; whatever we heard happened in Capernaum, do also here in your fatherland." 10, 12, 15  
*Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*

* **Governance (ἡγεμονίας \- hēgemonias):** *The Greek term is rendered here as "governance" rather than "reign" to reflect the administrative office held by Tiberius as a dry historical fact, avoiding the royal connotations of later ecclesiastical translations 3\.*  
* **He came down (κατῆλθεν \- katēlthen):** *In the canonical context, this implies moving geographically from the hills of Nazareth down to the sea-level of Capernaum. However, in the Proto-Luke reconstruction, where the Nazareth rejection (4:16-30) is relocated to follow the Capernaum ministry, this verb marks a "vertical" Christology—the descent of the Divine Human directly into historical time without the mediation of a biological birth 3, 7, 8\.*  
* **The Assembly (συναγωγήν \- synagōgēn):** *I have used "assembly" to maintain the literal sense of a gathering place, stripped of later specialized religious baggage Source context from previous persona instructions.*  
* **Relocation of Nazareth (4:16-30):** *Internal evidence reveals "editorial fatigue" in the canonical text, where the crowd in Nazareth mentions miracles in Capernaum before Jesus has actually visited Capernaum. In the Proto-Luke source, narrative logic is restored by placing the Capernaum ministry first, proving that the canonical editor "front-loaded" the rejection story for thematic purposes 12, 15-17.*  
* **Excision of Biological Paternity (4:22):** *The phrase "Is this not Joseph's son?" is absent from the earliest Marcionite/Jamesian witnesses. Its removal aligns with the Adoptionist view that Jesus was the Son of God by power and Spirit, not by fleshly descent 8, 12, 13, 17\.*  
* **Omission of 3:21–4:13:** *The Baptism of John and the Temptation in the Wilderness are absent in this earliest stratum. This preserves a Christology where the Savior requires no validation from the prophets of the old aeon, appearing as a fully empowered agent of the Divine 8, 18\.*
