The following is the forensic reconstruction of the fourth chapter of the **Jamesian Protograph** (Proto-Luke). This section moves from the establishment of the ethical constitution (the Sermon on the Plain) into the manifestation of the "Divine Human in Ultimates" 1, 2\. Here, authority is validated through works of restoration and a direct confrontation with the suffering of the poor and marginalized 3-5.

### THE GOSPEL (PROTO-LUKE): CHAPTER 4

**7:1** After he had ended all his words in the hearing of the people, he entered into Capernaum. **2** And a certain centurion’s **slave**, who was dear to him, was sick and at the point of death. **9** And when Jesus heard these things, he wondered at him, and turned and said to the crowd following him, "I tell you, I have not found such faith, no, not in Israel." **10** And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the **slave** whole.

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* **Slave (δοῦλος \- doulos):** *I have used "slave" to accurately reflect the social hierarchy of the time, rejecting the softer "servant" to highlight the total dependency of the subject Previous turn instruction, 1265\.*  
* **In Israel (ἐν τῷ Ἰσραήλ):** *Tertullian and Epiphanius both preserve this word order, which places the emphasis on the lack of internal spiritual loyalty within the established religious center 6, 7\.*

**12** Now when he came near to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow. **13** And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her. **14** And he came and touched the bier, and they that bore him stood still. And he said, "Young man, I say to you, arise." **15** And he that was dead sat up and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother. **16** And fear took hold of all, and they glorified God, saying, "A great prophet has **appeared** among us," and, "God has visited his people."

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* **Appeared (prodiit / προῆλθεν):** *Tertullian’s Latin (prodiit) suggests Marcion’s text may have used a verb meaning "appeared" or "came forth" rather than the canonical "arisen" (ἠγέρθη), possibly to avoid a specific physicalist resurrection theology at this early stage 8, 9\.*  
* **Prophet (προφήτης):** *The identification of Jesus as a prophet is a hallmark of the Jamesian layer, grounding him in the historical prophetic tradition of Israel rather than the later "Cosmic Christ" of Paul 10\.*

**19** And John, calling to him two of his disciples, sent them to Jesus, saying, "Are you the one coming, or do we look for another?" **22** Then Jesus answering said to them, "Go your way, and tell John what things you have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and to the **poor** the good news is announced. **23** And blessed is he, whoever shall not be offended in me."

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* **Poor (πτωχοί \- ptōchoi):** *The good news is specifically announced to the materially poor, reinforcing the Ebionite "Theology of Reversal" found in the previous chapter 11-13.*  
* **Dead are raised (νεκροὶ ἐγείρονται):** *Within the Jamesian matrix, these "works" serve as forensic proof of divine authority to remit sins and restore the "internal state" of humanity 3, 14\.*

**27** "This is he, of whom it is written: 'Behold, I send my **messenger** before your face, who shall prepare your way before you.'" **28** "For I say to you, among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist."

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* **Messenger (ἄγγελον \- angelon):** *I have translated this as "messenger" to denote the functional role of the figure (John), avoiding the supernatural baggage of "angel" Translation Philosophy.*  
* **Who shall prepare (ὃς κατασκευάσει):** *Tertullian and the Adamantius Dialogue confirm this wording for Marcion’s text, which tethers the movement to the "Old Testament" prophetic modulo while asserting Jesus as the fulfillment 15, 16\.*

**37** And, behold, a woman in the city, who was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster box of ointment. **38** And she stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment. **47** "Wherefore I say to you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much." **48** And he said to her, "Your sins are forgiven." **50** And he said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you; go in peace."

* *Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*  
* **Sinner (ἁμαρτωλός \- hamartōlos):** *The inclusion of the "sinful woman" highlights the Jamesian focus on proactive reconciliation over ritual purity 17, 18\.*  
* **She loved much (ἠγάπησεν πολύ):** *This confirms the "Works of Love" layer—that forgiveness and salvation are the result of the internal reality of love manifested in action (Ma'asim) 3, 17, 19\.*  
* **Your faith has saved you (ἡ πίστις σου σέσωκέν σε):** *In this context, "faith" is not the Pauline intellectual assent, but a "Faith-Loyalty" that compels the woman to act with devotion 17, 20, 21\.*

### Additional Explanation: The Mechanics of Restoration

This chapter of the Protograph consolidates the authority of Jesus through the **restoration of the marginalized**. In each instance, Jesus bypasses the established religious hierarchy to deal directly with "The Poor" and the "Outcast" 22, 23\.

1. **The Centurion’s Slave:** The focus is on **Distance and Faith**. Jesus does not need to be physically present; his authority resides in his "Word" 6\. This aligns with the pneumatic view that divine authority flows from the "Spirit" regardless of biological or material proximity 2, 14\.  
2. **The Widow’s Son:** By touching the bier, Jesus shatters the Sadducean laws of ritual pollution. He asserts that Love is the "Royal Law" that supersedes the "debris" of external ritual 2, 24\.  
3. **The Baptist’s Inquiry:** Jesus defines his identity through **function**, not genealogy. He tells John’s messengers to report the " Ultimates"—the physical changes in the poor and sick—which serve as the "fingerprint" of the Divine Influx 25, 26\.  
4. **The Woman who Loved:** This is the primary polemic against the "State Stabilization" (Orthodoxy) of the Pharisees. While the host focuses on the "rules" of hospitality, the woman focuses on the "inner reality" of love. Jesus rewards the latter, establishing that the "Kingdom" is entered through the internal fulfillment of the Law 18, 27, 28\.
