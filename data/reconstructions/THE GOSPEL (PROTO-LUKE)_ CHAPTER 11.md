The following is the forensic reconstruction of the eleventh chapter of **The Gospel** (Proto-Luke), based on the earliest historical witnesses and the Jamesian stratum 1, 2\. This reconstruction excises later "Orthodox" or "Harmonizing" additions, such as the Jerusalem Lament or the specific parables of tragedy in the opening verses, to reveal the dry facts of the primitive source 3, 4\.

### PROTO-LUKE CHAPTER 11

**13:1–9** These verses, including the report on the Galileans and the parable of the fig tree, are not present in this stratum 3\.  
**13:15** ... "Does not each one of you on the Sabbath untie his **donkey or his ox** from the manger and leading them away water them?" 5\.

* **Donkey or his ox** (*asinum aut bovem*):  
* *The specific word order here is preserved in the earliest Marcionite records, which differ from the later canonical inversion 5\.*  
* **Manger** (*φάτνης* — *phatnēs*):  
* *The Greek term refers specifically to a feeding trough; the comparison is used to expose the inconsistency of the legalistic restrictions on the Sabbath 5\.*

**13:16** "And this woman, being a daughter of **Abraham**, whom **the Satan** bound—behold, for eighteen years—was it not necessary to be loosed from this bond on the day of the Sabbath?" 6\.

* **The Satan** (*ὁ Σατανᾶς* — *ho Satanas*):  
* *The Greek retains the definite article, designating a functional entity or personification of unrighteousness rather than a proper name 6\.*  
* **Abraham**:  
* *The identification as a "daughter of Abraham" anchors the healing in the ethnic and communal context of the early Jerusalem mission 6\.*

**13:19** ... "It is like a grain of mustard, which a man taking cast into his own **garden**; and it grew and became a great tree, and the **birds** of the heaven nested in its branches" 7, 8\.

* **Garden** (*κῆπον* — *kēpon*):  
* *Unlike other synoptic variants that mention a "field," this stratum specifies a private garden, emphasizing internal cultivation 7\.*  
* **Birds** (*πετεινά* — *peteina*):  
* *The Greek word denotes winged creatures of the air; I have corrected this from my previous interpretation to strictly match the dry fact of the source text 8, 9\.*

**13:21** ... "It is like leaven, which a woman taking hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened" 10\.  
**13:25** "From the time the master of the house has risen and has locked the door, and you begin to stand outside and to knock at the door, saying, 'Lord, open to us,' and answering he will say to you, 'I do not know you, from where you are'" 11\.

* **Master of the house** (*οἰκοδεσπότης* — *oikodespotēs*):  
* *This term denotes a householder or a position of absolute domestic authority 11\.*

**13:26** "Then you will begin to say, 'We ate in your presence and drank, and you taught in our streets'" 11\.  
**13:27** "And he will say, I tell you, I do not know from where you are; depart from me, all you workers of **unrighteousness**" 11\.

* **Unrighteousness** (*ἀδικίας* — *adikias*):  
* *Translated as "unrighteousness" to preserve the forensic meaning of acting outside the established law or ethical order 12\.*

**13:28** "There will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth, when you see **all the righteous** in the kingdom of God, but you being **kept outside**" 13, 14\.

* **All the righteous** (*πάντας τοὺς δικαίους* — *pantas tous dikaious*):  
* *This is a critical variant where the names of the patriarchs (Abraham, Isaac, Jacob) are replaced by a general ethical category, emphasizing "Doing" over lineage 13\.*  
* **Kept outside** (*κρατουμένους* — *kratoumenous*):  
* *The text used in this stratum utilizes a verb meaning "to be held back" or "prevented" rather than "thrown out" (ekballomenous) 13, 14\.*

**13:29–35** The material concerning the warning about Herod and the lament over Jerusalem is not present in this stratum 4\.
