The following text continues the forensic reconstruction of the **Jamesian Protograph** (Proto-Luke), moving into the established ethical core of the movement. This stratum represents the foundational "Constitution" of the Jerusalem community, focusing on the economic and spiritual reversal characteristic of the **Ebionite** (Poor) ethos.  
In this reconstruction, the narrative bypasses the Judean institutional markers and moves directly to the mountain—the place of new law-giving—where the "Royal Law" is articulated.

### THE GOSPEL (PROTO-LUKE): CHAPTER 3

**6:12** And it happened in those days, he went out to the mountain to pray, and he was spending the night in the prayer of God. **13** And when it became day, he called his disciples, and choosing twelve from them, whom also he named **messengers**. 1, 2  
*Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*

* **Messengers (ἀποστόλους \- apostolous):**  
* *The dry fact of the Greek is "sent ones" or "emissaries." This reconstruction avoids the later high-church "Apostle" to reflect the functional role of these men as agents of the Kingdom 3\.*  
* **Mountain (τὸ ὄρος \- to oros):**  
* *In the Jamesian framework, the mountain is the site of the new "Opposition Priesthood" law-giving, mirroring Sinai but internalizing the command 4\.*

**20** And he, lifting up his eyes upon his disciples, said: "Blessed are you, the **poor**, for yours is the kingdom of God. **21** Blessed are you who hunger now, for you shall be satisfied. Blessed are you who weep now, for you shall laugh." 1, 5  
**24** "But woe to you, the **rich**, for you have received your consolation. **25** Woe to you who are full now, for you shall hunger. Woe, those laughing now, for you shall mourn and weep." 1, 5  
*Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*

* **Poor (πτωχοί \- ptōchoi):**  
* *Unlike the Matthean "poor in spirit," this stratum uses the literal term for material poverty. This aligns with the "Jamesian Layer" which identifies the followers as the **Ebionim** (The Poor) 2, 5\.*  
* **The Rich (πλουσίοις \- plousiois):**  
* *This forensic "Woe" is unique to the Lukan/Proto-Lukan stratum and is a primary marker of Jamesian theology, which views wealth as a consolidation of the current corrupt age 5, 6\.*

**27** "But to you who listen I say: Love your enemies, do well to those hating you. **28** Bless those cursing you, pray for those mistreating you. **29** To the one striking you on the jaw, offer also the other; and from the one taking your outer-garment, do not withhold the tunic." 1, 4  
**31** "And as you wish that men should do to you, do likewise to them. **35** But love your enemies and do good and lend, **despairing of nothing**; and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, for he is kind to the ungrateful and evil." 1, 2  
*Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*

* **Tunic (χιτῶνα \- chitōna):**  
* *This refers to the inner garment. The command is to allow the total stripping of the external self to preserve the internal "Royal Law" of love 4\.*  
* **Despairing of nothing (μηδὲν ἀπελπίζοντες \- mēden apelpizontes):**  
* *A difficult Greek phrase. In the Jamesian context, it implies an absolute reliance on Divine Influx rather than a calculated "return" on a loan, shunning the commercial logic of the state 5\.*

**46** "And why do you call me 'Lord, Lord,' and do not **do** what I say? **47** Everyone coming to me and hearing my words and **doing** them—I will show you whom he is like." 1, 2  
**48** "He is like a man building a house, who dug and deepened and laid a foundation upon the rock; and when a flood happened, the river broke against that house and was not strong enough to shake it, because it was built well." **49** "But the one hearing and not **doing** is like a man building a house upon the ground without a foundation, against which the river broke, and immediately it collapsed, and the crash of that house was great." 1, 2  
*Notes on Translation and Textual Logic:*

* **Doing (ποιῶν \- poiōn):**  
* *This present participle denotes continuous, active loyalty. This is the cornerstone of the "Jamesian Layer"—that "Faith-Alone" (the Pauline Layer) is insufficient without the **Ma'asim** (Works of Love) 2, 5\.*  
* **Foundation (θεμέλιον \- themelion):**  
* *In this stratum, the foundation is not a creed or a church hierarchy (Orthodoxy Layer), but the internal practice of the words of Christ in ultimates—actual ethical conduct 2, 4\.*

### Additional Explanation: The Charter of the Hebrews

Chapter 3 of the Jamesian Protograph establishes the movement's radical separation from both the Pauline pneumatic autonomy and the later Roman state-stabilization.

1. **Economic Reversal:** By retaining the "Woes" (6:24-26), Proto-Luke defines the Kingdom as a physical and social reality where the hierarchy of the world is inverted. This is a direct attack on any "Orthodoxy" that seeks to make the movement compatible with Roman wealth or status 5, 7\.  
2. **The Golden Rule as Law:** Verse 31 is presented not as a suggestion, but as the definition of the "Royal Law of Liberty." It functions as the internal governor of the "Opposition Priesthood," requiring the follower to act from the neighbor's perspective 4\.  
3. **The Rejection of Lip-Service:** The concluding parable of the two builders (6:46-49) serves as a forensic warning against the Pauline tendency to prioritize the "confession of the mouth" (Romans 10:9) over the "work of the hands." For the Jamesian Jesus, the house (the community) only stands if it is built on the **ultimates of action** 5, 8\.
