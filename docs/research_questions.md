# Proto-Luke Translation Research Questions (Round 2)

These questions relate to a scholarly reconstruction of the hypothetical "Proto-Luke" or Jamesian Protograph—an attempt to recover the earliest Gospel text that may have been used by Marcion and James's Jerusalem community. Following a complete review of the JSON file, I have identified several structural and textual questions that require scholarly clarification.

---

## Question 1: Chapter 2 Preamble - Chronological Contradiction ✅ RESOLVED

**Resolution:** The preamble has been corrected. The Additional Explanation was correct: Capernaum precedes Nazareth in the Proto-Luke reconstruction.

**Scholarly Basis:** The canonical Lukan order (Nazareth → Capernaum) represents secondary "thematic front-loading" that created **editorial fatigue**. In Luke 4:23, while in Nazareth, Jesus references "whatever we heard happened in Capernaum"—yet in canonical order he hasn't visited Capernaum yet. This proves the Capernaum events were originally prerequisite to the Nazareth confrontation.

**Corrected Preamble:** "In the reconstructed Jamesian sequence, the Capernaum ministry precedes the Nazareth rejection. This exorcism provides the empirical proof of authority that the Nazareth crowd later references in Luke 4:23 ('whatever we heard happened in Capernaum'). The canonical order reveals editorial fatigue—Luke's thematic front-loading created a structural inconsistency where Jesus is challenged about Capernaum miracles before he has visited Capernaum."

## Question 2: Chapter 1 to Chapter 2 Transition Gap ✅ RESOLVED

**Resolution:** The gap is intentional. The material spanning Luke 3:19–4:13 (John's imprisonment, baptism, genealogy, temptation) and 4:16–30 (Nazareth rejection) represents the "Orthodox Wrapper"—later theological interpolations added to domesticate the primitive narrative.

**Scholarly Basis:**
- **Vertical Christology:** In the Jamesian/Marcionite stratum, Baptism and Temptation are absent because they subordinate the Messenger to John the Baptist or test him against the "Creator." The Protograph's Christ descends fully empowered.
- **Genealogical Erasure:** Luke 3:23–38 severs the biological link to Adam—a "Pastoral" layer added later to anchor the narrative in Davidic biology.
- **Editorial Fatigue:** The Nazareth relocation (covered in Q1) resolves the 4:23 logic error.
- **Incipit Restoration:** Joining 3:1a directly to 4:31 restores the earliest Gospel sequence—the sudden pneumatic descent of the Divine Human into history.

**Note on κατῆλθεν (katēlthen):** In canonical Luke, "coming down" refers to geographical travel from Nazareth's hills to Capernaum. In the Protograph, the word follows the Tiberius/Pilate dating immediately, signifying a vertical descent into history rather than local geography.

## Question 3: Chapter 3 - The Twelve (Luke 6:12-16) - Multiple Sub-Questions

The reconstruction of the selection of the Twelve requires clarification on several textual and structural points.

---

### Question 3a: Verse Structure - Should Luke 6:12-13 be Combined? ✅ RESOLVED

**Resolution:** Luke 6:12 and 6:13 should remain **separate verses**. The earliest witnesses and internal logic treat the mountain prayer and selection as distinct forensic markers.

**Scholarly Basis:**
- **Codex Sinaiticus (01) & Vaticanus (03):** Both 4th-century uncials identify Luke 6:12 as a distinct narrative unit (Section 43 in critical apparatus).
- **Tertullian's Testimony:** References the mountain withdrawal independently in *Adversus Marcionem* 4.13.1 as a specific "work of power," then discusses the selection separately in 4.13.4 ("Cur autem duodecim apostolos elegit?").
- **Structural Rationale:** Separation preserves the deliberate "wait" in the text—the movement from night-long divine communion (pneumatic phase) to daylight human selection (institutional phase).

**Corrected Structure:**
- Verse 1 (Luke 6:12): Mountain prayer
- Verse 2 (Luke 6:13): Selection and designation
- Verse 3 (Luke 6:14-16): Name list

**Note on τῇ προσευχῇ τοῦ θεοῦ:** Retained as literal "prayer of God" (genitive), implying a state of being "in the prayer belonging to God" rather than softened "prayer to God."

---

### Question 3b: Position of οὓς καὶ ἀποστόλους ὠνόμασεν ✅ RESOLVED

**Resolution:** The repositioning to the end of verse 13 (before the name list) is **firmly supported** by the primary uncial witnesses.

**Manuscript Evidence:**
1. **Codex Sinaiticus (א / 01):** Places the clause directly at the end of verse 13, immediately after the selection of the twelve and before the name Simon. Confirms designation was part of functional commissioning, not a summary added after the list.
2. **Codex Vaticanus (B / 03):** Likewise preserves this sequence. The presence in both earliest 4th-century uncials establishes it as the primitive Lukan/Proto-Lukan reading. Relocation to end of list in later manuscripts is viewed as scribal attempt to provide summary closure.
3. **Tertullian's Testimony:** In *Adversus Marcionem* 4.13.4, addresses the selection of twelve and conferral of "apostle" title as a specific act of power before discussing individual identities—implying the Marcionite Evangelion treated designation as the climax of the selection process.

**Translation of ὠνόμασεν:**
- **"Designated" is correct** over "named" in this forensic/commissioning context
- While derived from ὄνομα (name), the verb here denotes formal conferral of a title, office, or rank
- Jesus is not giving a nickname but legally appointing them to a commission
- Consistent with forensic acts throughout the Jamesian stratum (e.g., renaming Simon to Peter as conferral of authority)

**Structural Logic:**
The Messenger first selects the group → then confers the official rank (emissary) → finally identifies individuals by name. This sequence emphasizes office over individual biological identities.

### Question 3c: The Name List (Luke 6:14-16) - Was it in Proto-Luke? ✅ RESOLVED

**Resolution:** The full twelve-name list should be **abbreviated** with ellipses to indicate the forensic gap. Only names explicitly attested in the Marcionite layer are preserved.

**Scholarly Basis:**
- **Tertullian's Testimony (Adv. Marc. 4.13.6):** Specifically attests Simon/Peter (renaming as "act of power") and Judas Iscariot (the betrayer). Tertullian passes over the intermediate names in silence.
- **Forensic Gap:** The middle names (Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot) are strictly **unattested** in the Marcionite layer.
- **Evangelist Names Controversy:** Early readers noted names "not written in the Gospel"—forensic analysis of the Adamantius Dialogue clarifies this refers to the Evangelists (Mark, Luke), not the Twelve.

**Corrected Structure:**
- **Verse 3 (Luke 6:14):** "Simon, whom also he named Peter, and Andrew his brother, [and James and John]..."
- **Verse 4 (Luke 6:15):** "..." (forensic gap)
- **Verse 5 (Luke 6:16):** "[and Judas of James] and Judas Iscariot, who became a betrayer."

**Key Notes:**
- **Named Peter (Πέτρον):** Attested by Tertullian as "Work of Power"
- **Betrayer (προδότης):** Verified by Tertullian, essential to narrative arc
- **Iscariot (Ἰσκαριώθ):** Western tradition spelling retained
- Brackets indicate high-probability but unverified names
- Ellipses indicate forensic gap where names are not attested

# Proto-Luke Translation Research Questions (Round 3)

## Question 4: Terminology for Jesus - "the Messenger" vs "Jesus" vs "the Anointed One" ✅ RESOLVED

**Resolution:** The title "the Messenger" (when referring to Jesus) should be replaced with **"Jesus"** for historical identification and **"the Anointed One"** for his functional title. Lowercase "messenger" translating ἄγγελος is retained.

### Terminology

**Jesus (Ἰησοῦς)** — Historical Identification
- The historically unambiguous name preserved across all strata
- In the Jamesian context, a biological human of dynastic lineage (the Desposyni), not a pneumatic phantom
- The narrative incipit identifies "Jesus" as the specific historical vessel descending into the timeframe of Tiberius and Pilate

**The Anointed One (ὁ χριστός)** — Forensic Title
- Literal translation of Hebrew משיח (Mashiah) and Greek χριστός
- Strips away high-theological debris of "Christ" (which has become a surname in Western narrative)
- Restores the specific Second Temple claim to the throne of David
- The Jerusalem Pillars viewed Jesus as "the Anointed One" whose intercessory authority was continued by James the Just

**messenger (ἄγγελος)** — Lowercase, Retained
- Denotes those sent with a specific legal or divine mandate
- Applies to celestial beings or human envoys (e.g., John's disciples, the seventy)
- Maintains clinical distinction between the Sovereign and his representatives

### Rationale for Displacement of "the Messenger"

- **Removal of Gnostic Vector:** The title echoes Marcionite/Gnostic concept of an "alien" emissary from the Pleroma. In the Jamesian stratum, Jesus is a restorationist "Opposition High Priest" rooted in the material world and Torah.
- **Philological Consistency:** The Greek uses Ἰησοῦς as name and ὁ χριστός as title. "The Messenger" prioritizes an interpretive framework over manuscript facts.
- **Hierarchical Clarity:** Calling Jesus "the Messenger" confuses his identity with the emissaries (ἀποστόλους) and messengers (ἀγγέλους) he himself commissioned.

## Question 5: "Soma Pneumatikon" - Pauline Terminology in a Jamesian Text? ✅ RESOLVED

**Resolution:** The Pauline term "Soma Pneumatikon" should be replaced with Jamesian terminology: **"The Living One"** (ὁ ζῶν) for the post-mortal Jesus, and **"Exaltation"** for the enthronement event.

### Reconstructed Terminology

| Jamesian Term | Greek/Hebrew | Forensic Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Living One** | ὁ ζῶν (*ho zōn*) | Title for one vindicated and existing in the pneumatic realm |
| **Appeared** | ὤφθη (*ōphthē*) | Standard forensic term for visionary perception |
| **Exalted/Exaltation** | *Exaltatio* | Enthronement at the "Right Hand of Power" |
| **Spirit** | πνεῦμα (*pneuma*) | The witnesses' default classification (non-corporeal transport) |

### Rationale for Displacement

- **Davidic Necrolatry:** The Jerusalem Church preserved Jesus's tomb (Talpiot) as dynastic memory. Paul's "spiritual body" replacing the physical shell was alien to this community.
- **Translation Fable:** The Jamesian community viewed post-mortem events through prophetic translation (Elijah, Moses)—exaltation to heaven, not medical resurrection.
- **Philological Honesty:** "The Living One" and "Exaltation" restore the prophetic vocabulary of the "Assembly of the Hebrews."

### Status: PENDING IMPLEMENTATION

## Question 6: Preface Text - Forensic Methodology and Witnesses ✅ RESOLVED

**Resolution:** The preface should be rewritten to reflect the scholarly grounding of the reconstruction.

### I. Marcionite Priority and Editorial Fatigue

The "New Marcionite Paradigm" posits that the *Evangelion* represents a pre-canonical stratum of the Lukan tradition.

**Key Scholarly Sources:**
- **Matthias Klinghardt**, *The Oldest Gospel and the Formation of the Canonical Gospels* (2015/2021): Identifies editorial fatigue as primary proof—canonical Luke exhibits fatigue when diverging from the Marcionite text.
- **Jason BeDuhn**, *The First New Testament: Marcion's Scriptural Canon* (2013): Demonstrates that differences are absences of material not yet added, not Marcionite excisions.
- **Markus Vinzent**, *Christ's Resurrection in Early Christianity* (2011): Argues Marcion's shorter resurrection text was the baseline later "materialized" by orthodox editors.

**Example:** The Capernaum fatigue (Luke 4:23)—Jesus references Capernaum miracles before visiting Capernaum in canonical order.

### II. The "Orthodox Wrapper"

**Note:** "Orthodox Wrapper" is a project-specific coinage for transparency. Scholarly equivalents:
- **"Pastoral Prologue"**: Luke 1–2 (infancy narratives, Temple piety, Davidic biology)
- **"Orthodox Redaction"**: Later additions to domesticate the pneumatic Jesus into biological/political framework

### III. Western Non-Interpolations

Term coined by **Westcott and Hort** (19th c.) for passages present in Alexandrian manuscripts but absent in Western tradition (Codex Bezae, Old Latin).

**Key Passages Excised:**
- Luke 24:3: "of the Lord Jesus"
- Luke 24:6: "He is not here, but has been raised"
- Luke 24:12: Peter's visit to tomb
- Luke 24:39-43: Physicalist proofs (flesh, bones, fish)
- Luke 24:51: "carried up into heaven"

These restore a narrative where the empty tomb is a sign of **absence and perplexity**, not forensic proof of resuscitation.

### Status: PENDING IMPLEMENTATION (Preface to be rewritten)
